Take me now, baby, here as I am
Hold me close, and try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt, baby, when I'm alone
Love is a ring, a telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed 'til the morning comes

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With love we sleep, with doubt the vicious cycle turns, and burns
Without you oh I cannot live, forgive the yearning Burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So take me now, take me now, take me now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
And everybody says that it belongs to us"

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
""What's going on?""

And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said ""Hey, a-what's going on?""
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said ""Hey, a-what's going on?""

Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh

And I try
Oh my God, do I try
I try all the time
In this institution
And I pray
Oh my God, do I pray
I pray every single day
For revolution

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
""What's going on?""

And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said ""Hey, what's going on?""

Spent my nights awake and I wonder
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not lead to solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

Staring at this yellow-haired girl

With a black-haired flamenco dancer
You know, she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful

So come dance this silence down through the morning
Sha-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah
Cut up, Maria
Show me some of them Spanish dances and
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
'Cause I wanna be someone who believes
Yeah

Tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at them beautiful women
She's looking at you
Oh no, no, she's looking at me
Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you
You can never be lonely

Well, I'm gon' paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red, and black, and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me
Look into the future
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's looking at you
I don't think so, she's looking at me
Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me
I will never be lonely

I will never be lonely
Said, I'm never gonna be lonely

I wanna be a lion
Yeah, everybody wanna pass as cats
We all wanna be big, big stars
Yeah, but we got different reasons for that
Believe in me
'Cause I don't believe in anything
And I, I wanna be someone to believe
To believe, to believe, yeah

Mr. Jones and me
Stumbling through the barrio
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's perfect for you
Man, there's got to be somebody for me
I wanna be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone
Just a little more funky
When everybody loves you
Oh son, that's just about as funky as you can be
Mr. Jones and me
Staring at the video
When I look at the television, I wanna see me
Staring right back at me
We all wanna be big stars
But we don't know why and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me
I wanna be just about as happy as I can be

So put your feet in the water
Put your head in the water

To stay clean and constantly baptized (oh)

And to wait for a flood
Is to wait for life

But first I must learn to swim all over again

Save you from your misery

And I swore, I swore I would be true
And honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

But I'm in so deep

Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

Oh, I thought the world of you

But I was wrong, I was wrong
If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie

And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just want to be with you

And I'm in so deep

Got into an accident and couldn't come to school
But when he finally came back
His hair had turned from black into bright white
He said that it was from when
The cars had smashed so hard

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Once there was this girl who
Wouldn't go and change with the girls in the change room
But when they finally made her
They saw hurt marks all over her body
She couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just been there

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

But both girl and boy were glad
'Cause one kid had it worse than that

'Cause then there was this boy whose
Parents made him come directly home right after school
And when they went to their church
They shook and lurched all over the church floor
He couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just gone there

I've been a long
A long way from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And drank 'til I was thirsty again
We went searchin'
Through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

Well, okay, I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

You get down
Real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well, who hasn't been there before?
I come 'round
Around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you French toast again

Well, okay, I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

We've been far
Far away from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And everywhere in-between

Well, okay, we get along
So what if right now everything's wrong?

Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes

More than just friends
I know you think that if we move too soon
It would all end
I live in misery when you're not around ('Round, 'round)
And I won't be satisfied till we're taking those vows

There'll be some lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking

Are watching you
They know my heart and speak to yours like only lovers do
If I could wear your clothes
I'd pretend I was you
And lose control

There'll be some lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking

Hold me tight and don't let go (Don't let go)

Running in and out my life
Has got me so confused
You gotta make the sacrifice
Somebody's got to choose
We can make it if we try, for the sake of you and I
Together we can make it right

What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend?
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go (Don't let go)
You have the right to lose control (Don't let go)

You've got the right to lose control
Don't let go
Don't let go 'cause I can't pretend

Of light mists, of pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you
Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer night air (Summer night, summer night air)
A secret (Secret) moment shared in the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft-spoken words

Say it, say it again

I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere, I will be with you
Everything (Say it, say it again), I will do for you
I love you, always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere, I will be with you
Everything, I will do for you

You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes
I've ever seen
You've got me almost melting away
As we lay there
Under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness, a magical time

Say it, say it again

Arm me with harmony
Dave, drop a load on 'em

O.P.P., how can I explain it? I'll take it, frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it
O is for ""other,"" P is for ""people,"" scratch your temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple, huh
It's sort of like, oh well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missing here
You get it on occasion if the other party isn't gaming
It seems I gotta start the explaining, bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello?
You get her name and number, then left feeling real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house?
It's not a front, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Oh, that's why she's scary)
It's O.P.P. time, other people's, but you get it
There's no room for relationships, there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at?
Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splitting and co-hitting that?
Well, if you do, that's O.P.P., and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (Every last homie)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the homies)

Well, for the ladies, O.P.P. means something gifted
The first two letters the same, but the last is something different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five-letter word rhyming with ""cleanest"" or ""meanest""
I won't get into that, I'll do it, uh, sort of properly
I'll say the last P, hmm, stands for ""property""
Now lady, here comes a kiss
Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife?
And you just had to stop a toast 'cause he looked just that nice?
You looked at him, he looked at you, and you knew right away
He had someone, but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door, no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet door
Now don't be shy, 'cause if you're down, I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. (O.P.P.), I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (Every last lady)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the ladies)

A scab tried to O.P.P. me, I had a girl and she knew that
Matter fact, her and my girl was partners that
Had a fall-out, disagreement, yeah, an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing, it must've been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cause after that she kept on coming back and catching feelings
I said, ""Let's go, my girl is coming, so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you, Treach,"" I said, ""Now, child, please
You gots to leave, come grab your coat right now, you gotta go""
I said, ""Now look, you choose the stairs or choose the stair window
This was a fling, a little thing you shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cause you know I was O.P.P., hell, from the very start""
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting, isn't it? A special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messing with
Him or her, for sure, I'm going to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy, I'm with it

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (This whole party)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (This whole party)

Just another morning lying there for me
And in your mind you're always running
Keep on running, run away from me
I spent all my time
Chasing you around
It's that way now I found out for sure
I spent all my time
Chasing you around
It's that way now I found out for sure
Said you'd stay and make it better
We'd stay together is what you said to me
But you left without a warning
And now another morning is lying there for me
I spent all my time
Chasing you around
It's that way now I found out for sure
I spent all my time
Chasing you around
It's that way now I found out for sure
And everytime that I try to get to you
There's nothing I can say
We tried but it seems there's nothing left to do
But I'll wait anyway

I spent all my time

(Background chatter)
This is how we do it!
(This is how we do it!)
Sha la la la la la lo
Shabada lo lo lo, whoa
(This is how we do it!)
Lo lo lo low-oh-oh

This is how we do it
It's Friday night, and I feel alright
The party is here on the West Side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver, take the keys to my truck
Hit the 'shaw cause I'm faded
Honies in the street say, ""Monty, yo, we made it!""
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid

So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (this is how we do it)

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wannabe player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case g
But now I'm a big G
The girls see I got the money
Hundred-dollar bills, y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway

So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say...

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
Y?N-Vee, SCC (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)

Check it out!
Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
All they said was 6' 8"" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good
There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
You and Oji are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we're makin' tha dash

Ohh, I'm buzzin' because... (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)

Oh, it's party time! (This is how we do it)
Straight up comin' from the West Side (This is how we do it)
OG's got the flavor, yeah (This is how we do it)
And Monty does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
C'mon now, Def Jam, you know what it is (This is how we do it)

Yo Montell, this Percy, man
The barber, your barber
Man I'm sitting up here listening to ya tape, dude
And this shit is on, man
You gon' make it, fool
Keep on doing what you doing, man

But, uh

If I could tell the world just one thing it would be
That we're all okay
And not to worry 'cause worry is wasteful and useless in times like these
I won't be made useless
I won't be idle with despair
I will gather myself around my faith
For light does the darkness most fear

My hands are small, I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own and
I am never broken
Poverty stole your golden shoes
It didn't steal your laughter
And heartache came to visit me
But I knew it wasn't ever after
We'll fight, not out of spite
For someone must stand up for what's right
'Cause where there's a man who has no voice
There ours shall go singing

My hands are small, I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own and
I am never broken

In the end, only kindness matters
In the end, only kindness matters

I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
I will get down on my knees, and I will pray

My hands are small, I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own and
I am never broken
My hands are small, I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own and
I am never broken
We are never broken

With one light on in one room
I know you're up when I get home
With one small step upon the stair
I know your look when I get there

If you were a king up there on your throne
Would you be wise enough to let me go?
For this queen you think you own

Wants to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go

The unread book and painful look
The TV's on, the sound is down
One long pause, then you begin
Oh, look what the cat's brought in

If you were a king up there on your throne
Would you be wise enough to let me go?
For this queen you think you own

Wants to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go, let me leave

For the crown you've placed upon my head feels too heavy now
And I don't know what to say to you, but I'll smile anyhow
And all the time I'm thinking, thinking

I want to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go

I want to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go, let me leave
Let me go"

Though the bird is on the wing

Try to love one another right now
Some will come and some will go
And we shall surely pass
When the one that left us here
Returns for us at last
We have but a moments on life
Fading in the grass

Wanna grab all all your friend
Nothing for deal and is just for making

Must forward in this generation
Seek the truth in your heart, in your mind
Do what's right and you shall fight
There's a universal family
Peace my brothers and my sisters
C'mon people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
If you hear the song I sing
You will understand (listen)
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
Just when key unlocks them both
It's there at your command

How 'bout me enjoying the moment for once
How 'bout how good it feels to finally forgive you
How 'bout grieving it all one at a time

Was the moment I got more than I could handle
The moment I jumped off of it
Was the moment I touched down

How 'bout remembering your divinity
How 'bout unabashedly bawling your eyes out
How 'bout not equating death with stopping

Someday, when my life has passed me by
I'll lay around and wonder why you were always there for me
One way, in the eyes of a passerby
I'll look around for another try and fade away

Just close your eyes, and I'll take you there
This place is warm without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave and you reach for me

Some say better things will come our way
No matter what they try to say, you were always there for me
Some way, when the sun begins to shine
I hear a song from another time and fade away
And fade away

Just close your eyes, and I'll take you there

Someone said we got it all (Someday, I wonder why)

Is there a place where I belong? (Someday will)

Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blowtorch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning
So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow, I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile?
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded?
Life's mystery seems so faded
I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am, just a-drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night
Earth and sky
Somehow, I just don't believe it

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there


Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughing at the rain
A little out of touch, a little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train never coming back
Runaway train tearing up the track
Runaway train burning in my veins
I run away, but it always seems the same"

I was walking around, just a face in the crowd
Trying to keep myself out of the rain
Saw a vagabond king wear a styrofoam crown
Wondered if I might end up the same
There's a man out on the corner
Singing old songs about change
Everybody got their cross to bare these days

She came looking for some shelter
With a suitcase full of dreams
To a motel room on the boulevard
I guess she's trying to be James Dean
She's seen all the disciples
And all the wannabes
No one wants to be themselves these days
Still there's nothing to hold on to but these days

These days, the stars seem out of reach
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets
These days are fast, nothing lasts in this graceless age
There ain't nobody left but us these days

Jimmy Shoes, he busted both his legs
Trying to learn to fly
From a second story window
He just jumped and closed his eyes
His momma said he was crazy
He said, ""Momma, i've got to try
Don't you know that all my heroes died?
And I guess I'd rather die than f-f-fade away"", yeah

These days, the stars seem out of reach, yeah
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets, oh no no
These days are fast, nothing lasts, it's a graceless age
Even innocence has caught the midnight train
There ain't nobody left but us these days

(Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh) I know Rome's still burning
(Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh) Though the times have changed
(Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh) This world keeps turning round and round and round and round these days


These days, the stars seem out of reach, yeah
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets, oh no no
These days are fast, love don't last, it's a graceless age
Even innocence has caught the midnight train
These days, the stars seem out of reach, yeah
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets, oh no no
These days are fast, nothing lasts, there ain't no time to waste
There ain't nobody left to take the blame
Oh no no no, ain't nobody left but us these days
Ain't nobody left but us these days"

You turn me on, you lift me up
And like the sweetest cup, I'd share with you
You lift me up, don't you ever stop, I'm here with you
Now it's all or nothing
'Cause you said you'll follow through
You follow me, and I,-I-I follow you

What you gonna do when things go wrong?
What you gonna do when it all cracks up?
What you gonna do when the love burns down?
What you gonna do when the flames go up?
Who is gonna come and turn the tide?
What's it gonna take to make a dream survive?
Who's got the touch to calm the storm inside?
Who's gonna save you?

Alive and kicking
Stay until your love is alive and kicking
Stay until your love is, until your love is alive

Oh, you lift me up to the crucial top, so I can see
Oh, you lead me on till the feelings come
And the lights that shine on
But if that don't mean nothing
Like if someday it should fall through
You'll take me home where the magic's from
And I'll be with you

What you gonna do when things go wrong?
What you gonna do when it all cracks up?
What you gonna do when the Love burns down?
What you gonna do when the flames go up?
Who is gonna come and turn the tide?
What's it gonna take to make a dream survive?
Who's got the touch to calm the storm inside?
Don't say goodbye, don't say goodbye
In the final seconds who's gonna save you?

Oh, alive and kicking
Stay until your love is, love is, alive and kicking
Oh, alive and kicking
Stay until your love is, love is, alive and kicking"

We're kickin' the flow! (We're kickin' the flow!)
And it goes a little something like this!

Tag Team, back again
Check it to wreck it, let's begin
Party on, party people, let me hear some noise
DC's in the house, jump, jump, rejoice
Says there's a party over here, a party over there
Wave your hands in the air, shake the derriere
These three words mean you're gettin' busy
Whoomp, there it is! Hit me!

Upside down and inside out
I'm 'bout to show all you folks what it's all about
Now it's time for a nigga to get on the mic
And make this motherfuckin' party hype
I'm takin' it back to the old school
'Cause I'm an old fool who's so cool
If you wanna get down, I'mma show you the way
Whoomp, there it is! Let me hear you say

Rip shit, find a honey dip to dip it in
Slam dunk it, stick it, flip it and ride

Amazing, outstanding, demanding
Commanding, you people dancing (Whoo)

You wanna come down to the underground old school?
Here's a shovel, can you dig it, fool?

To the fly shit from the school of old
Hard core, keep' the folklore wrecked
3 to the 2 and 1, mic check
Mad skill, flow ill, on the mess of steel
That's the grille of the microphone I just killed
Party people, there's your party, Tag Team is through

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she living, she golden
She lives for me, says she lives for the ovation
Her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I'll make you smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give 'em the games she play, she say

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

The sky was gold, it was rose, I was taking sips of it to my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now, I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that filthy dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
Slides up around the belly face down on the mattress one
And you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself, head made of the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

And I want something else
To get me through this life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

We are young, we run green

Smoke a fag, put it out

And feel alright

Are we like you?
I can't be sure
Of the scene as she turns
We are strange in our worlds

But we are young, we get by
Can't go mad, ain't got time
Sleep around if we like
But we're alright

Got some cash, bought some wheels
Took it out 'cross the fields
Lost control, hit a wall
But we're alright

Are we like you?

I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around
Oh yeah

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race, a prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV (rock and roll TV)
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me (Yeah, Yeah!)
Freedom!
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
I will not give you up (Freedom!)
Gotta have some faith in the sound
(You got to give what you take)
It's the one good thing that I've got, (Freedom!)
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
So please don't give me up (Freedom!)
Cause I would really, really love to stick around (You got to give what you take)

Heaven knows we sure had some fun, boy
What a kick, just a buddy and me
(What a kick, just a buddy and me)
We had every big-shot goodtime band on the run, boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race, got out of the place
Went back home, got a brand new face for the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change oh yeah (Oh, yeah)
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don’t think that I’ll be back again
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me (Yeah, Yeah!)
Freedom
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
I will not give you up, (Freedom!)
Gotta have some faith in the sound
(You got to give what you take)
It's the one good thing that I've got (Freedom!)
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
So please don't give me up (Freedom!)
Cause I would really, really love to stick around (You got to give what you take)

Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last
That's what you get, that's what you get, that's what you get
I say that's what you get
I say that's what you get
That's what you get for changing your mind
And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now (Oh, yeah)
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me (Yeah, Yeah!)
Freedom! (Oh!)
Freedom!

You got to give what you take!
Freedom!
I'll hold on to my (Freedom!)
My (Freedom!)
You got to give what you take! (You got to give what, to give what, to give what you take!)

Yeah!
You got to give what, to give what, to give
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now
I've got to live"

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide hoo ride, ain't no valley low enough or mountain high

I'm tryin' to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside without livin' in fear of a drive-by
And even if I get away from them drive by killas
I still gotta worry about those snitch ass niggas
I keep on searchin' and I keep on lookin'
But niggas are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be actin' like they evil
You don't understand about runnin' with a gang
'Cause you don't gang bang
And you don't have to stand on the corner and slang
'Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left

Come along and ride on a Fantastic Voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I do what I do just to survive
(Come along and ride on a Fantastic Voyage)
Slide slide hoo ride, that's why I pack my 45

Life is a bitch and then you die
Still trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Every game ain't the same 'cause the game still remain
Don't it seem kinda strange ain't a damn thing changed
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down ass niggas can ride with me
Hop hop hop the 5 quickly down the block
Stay sucker free and keep the busters off your jock
You gotta have heart son if you wanna go
Watch this switch chariot, swing low
Ain't nobody crying, ain't nobody dyin'
Ain't nobody worryin', everybody's tryin'
Nothing from nothin' leaves nothin'
If you wanna have somethin' you better stop frontin'
What you gonna do when the 5 roll by?
You better be ready so you can ride

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity slide when you're living in the city it's do or die
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide hoo ride you better be ready when the 5 roll by

Just roll along (that's what you do)
Just roll along (that's right)
Just roll along (that's what you do)
Just roll along (that's right)

So one of these nights and about twelve o'clock
This old world's gonna reel and rock

For the Lord's gonna come in his heavenly airplane


If God had a name, what would it be?
And would you call it to His face
If you were faced with Him in all His glory?
What would you ask if you had just one question?

And yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good

What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Tryna make his way home?

If God had a face, what would it look like?
And would you want to see
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
In things like heaven and in Jesus and the saints
And all the prophets?

Lemon, see-through in the sunlight
She wore lemon but never in the daylight
She's gonna make you cry
She's gonna make you whisper and moan
When you're dry she draws her water from the stone
I feel like I'm slowly, slowly, slowly slippin' under
I feel like I'm holding on to nothing

She wore lemon to colour in the cold grey night
She had heaven and she held on so tight
A man makes a picture
A moving picture
Through the light projected
He can see himself up close
A man captures colour
A man likes to stare
He turns his money into light
To look for her
And I feel like I'm drifting, drifting, drifting from the shore
And I feel like I'm swimming out to her

Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins

Lemon, see-through in the sunlight
A man builds a city
With banks and cathedrals
A man melts the sand
So he can see the world outside (You're gonna meet her there)
A man makes a car (She's your destination)
And builds a road to run them on (You gotta get to her)
A man dreams of leaving (She's imagination)
But he always stays behind
And these are the days when our work has come asunder
And these are the days when we look for something other

Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins


Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins

A man makes a picture
A moving picture
Through the light projected
He can see himself up close (You're gonna meet her there)
A man captures colour (She's your destination)
A man likes to stare (There's no sleeping there)
He turns his money into light (She's imagination)
To look for her

She's imagination (She had heaven)

Movin' to the country, I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches

They were put there by a man
In a factory downtown
If I had my little way
I'd eat peaches every day
Sun-soakin' bulges in the shade

I took a little nap where the roots all twist
Squished a rotten peach in my fist
And dreamed about you, woman
I poked my finger down inside
Make a little room for an ant to hide
Nature's candy in my hand or can or a pie

Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication

It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication

Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station??
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there, and I don't mean on vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication


Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

On the grind

No time
Always running here and there
Chasing the money
So much jibber jabber's clogging up our soul

Where are we running?
We need some time to clear our head
Where are we running?
Keep on working 'til we're dead

Got to buy
The new Cavalli
Keep the skin tight
And the booty in the air
Don't stop the party
The road is paved but narrow
I hope we all get home

Where are we running?
We need some time to clear our head
Where are we running?
Keep on working 'til we're dead

Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio
Still, I can't escape the ghost of you

What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize?
(Gone away)

But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well now, pride's gone out the window, 'cross the rooftops, run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart

What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
(Gone away)

But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, Ah-uh-huh

Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here beside the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk (Just blown away)

And I don't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Every world is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any world is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any world is my world

I feel the question of your loneliness
Confide, 'cause I'll be on your side

Alone and desperate on the prison phone
They want to give her seven years
For being sad

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

My friends are so distressed
And standing on the brink of emptiness
No words I know of to express
This emptiness

I love all of you

So hard and lonely too

Imagine me
Taught by tragedy
Release is peace

And what she said was something beautiful
""To give your love no matter what""
Was what she said

So hard and lonely too

Put it in your heart and then keep it
Something that I want you to know
Do something for me
Listen to my simple story
And maybe we'll have something to show
You tell me you're cold on the inside
How can the outside world
Be a place that your heart can embrace
Be good to yourself
'Cause nobody else
Has the power to make you happy
How can I help you
Please let me try to
I can heal the pain
That you're feeling inside
Whenever you want me
You know that I will be
Waiting for the day
That you say you'll be mine
He must have really hurt you
To make you say the things that you do
He must have really hurt you
To make those pretty eyes look so blue

He must have known
That he could
That you'd never leave him
Now you can't see my love is good
And that I'm not him
How can I help you
Please let me try to
I can heal the pain
Won't you let me inside
Whenever you want me
You know that I will be
Waiting for the day
That you say you'll be mine
Won't you let me in
Let this love begin
Won't you show me your heart now
I'll be good to you
I can make this thing true
Show me that heart right now
Who needs a lover
That can't be a friend
Something tells me I'm the one you've been looking for, oh
If you ever should see him again
Won't you tell him you've found someone who gives you more

Someone who will protect you
Love and respect you
All those things
That he never could bring to you
Like I do or rather I would
Won't you show me your heart
Like you should
How can I help you
Please let me try to
I can heal the pain
That you're feeling inside

Won't you show me your heart now
I'll be good to you
I can make this thing true
And get to your heart somehow"

Hit it
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club, either
This is L.A. 

""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me, out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosin' and scrubbin' as best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store, too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, 'cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Lettin' each one burn, down to his thick fingers
Before blowin' and cursin' them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash, too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon, but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard"

Cold and frosty morning, there's not a lot to say
About the things caught in my mind
And as the day was dawning, my plane flew away
With all the things caught in my mind

And I wanna be there when you're coming down
And I wanna be there when you hit the ground

So don't go away, say what you say
Say that you'll stay forever and a day
In the time of my life, 'cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time just to make things right

Damn my situation and the games I have to play
With all the things caught in my mind
Damn my education, I can't find the words to say
With all the things caught in my mind

And I wanna be there when you're calling down
And I wanna be there when you hit the ground

So don't go away, say what you say
Say that you'll stay forever and a day
In the time of my life, 'cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time just to make things right

Me and you, what's going on?
All we seem to know is how to show
The feelings that are wrong

So don't go away, say what you say
Say that you'll stay forever and a day

Give it up for Naughty By Nature!

Hip hop hooray
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho

You drew a picture of my mornin', but you couldn't make my day (Hey!)
I'm rockin' and you're yawnin', but you never look my way (Hey!)
I'm lickin' down your darlin' in every single way (Hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign and a green card's on the way
This ain't got shit to do with shampoo, but watch your head and shoulder
Brother older, bold enough to fold ya, yo, I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made and played it, plus a funky fit
So save yo' flips and tricks for that music and the monkey bit
Triggers from the Grilltown Illtown
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real, so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom, ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what you're thinkin', 'cause I'm vampin'
I live and die for hip-hop, this is hip-hop for today
I give props to hip-hop, so hip hop hooray

Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho
Hip hop hooray
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho

You heard a lot about a brother gainin' mo' ground
Bein' low down, I do the showdown with any little ho 'round
No! I wanna know who you believe in
Through your funny reasons even when I'm sleepin' you think I'm cheatin'
You said: ""I know you, Mr. O.P.P. man
Yo, PP man, won't only see me man""
You should've known when I ain't hit it and step
That I was wit' it a bit, not to consider the rep, heck!
I did your partner 'cause she's hot as a baker
'Cause I'm Naughty by Nature, not 'cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark
You try to act like somethin' really big is missin'
Even though my name's graffiti-written on your kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today; Hip Hop Hooray

Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho
Hip hop hooray
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho

Hip Hop, Hip Hip Hop, Hip Hip Hop, Hooray!
There's many hungry hip-hoppers
One reason Hip Hop's tip-top today
Swerve what you heard 'cause I ain't bailin' no hay
Ain't choppin' no crops, but still growin' every day
Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Illtown drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns, beatdowns are found
Don't know me? Don't come around!
Tippy tippy (pause) tippy tippy (pause)
Sometimes creepin' up I eat 'em up
Your styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That way I shout-out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish, neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitties purr, now call me sir too
Lookin' for her crew; any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof
My problem solver's name is Mook
I hittin' woodies in a hoodie
Peace to Josette, Jobete, Jo-Jo, Genae, and every hood G
That's right, my fight is ill
Peace goes to L.O.N.S. and Quest
Nice & Smooth and Cypress Hill
I live and die for Hip Hop, this is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop, so Hip Hop Hooray

Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho
Hip hop hooray
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make somethin'
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
When mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feelin' I could be someone
Be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feelin' I could be someone
Be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together, you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on drivin'

So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feelin' I could be someone

While those around him criticize and sleep
And through a fractal on a breaking wall

But we're never gonna survive, unless

One of them's got a gun, to shoot the other one
And yet together they were friends at school
Ohh, get it, get it, get it, get it no no
If all were there when we first took the pill
Then maybe, then maybe, then maybe, then maybe
Miracles will happen as we speak

But we're never gonna survive, unless

I know what's good for you
(You can touch me if you want)
I know you're dying to
(You can touch me if you want)
I know what's good for you
(You can touch me if you want)

The queerest of the queer
The strangest of the strange
The coldest of the cool
The lamest of the lame
The numbest of the dumb
I hate to see you here
You choke behind a smile
A fake behind the fear
The queerest of the queer
The strangest of the strange
The coldest of the cool
You're nothing special here
A fake behind the fear

Don't wanna wait 'til tomorrow
Why put it off another day?
One by one, little problems
Build up, and stand in our way, oh
One step ahead, one step behind it
Now you gotta run to get even
Make future plans or dream about yesterday? Hey
Come on, turn, turn this thing around

Right now, hey
It's your tomorrow
Right now
Come on, it's everything
Right now
Catch that magic moment
And do it right here and now
It means everything

Miss the beat, you lose the rhythm
And nothing falls into place, no
Only missed by a fraction
Slipped a little off your pace, oh
The more things you get, the more you want
Just trading one for the other
Workin' so hard to make it easy, woah, got to turn
Come on, turn this thing around

Right now, hey
It's your tomorrow
Right now
Come on, it's everything

Do it right here and now

But everything about you is tellin' me this time

Those words grow distant as I look at your face

What a mighty good man (You got to say it again now)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Yeah, he's a mighty, mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Yes, he is)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Oh, uh, yeah)

I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are hoes, he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic to let it
Get me involved in that he said, she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it, and believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
Hahaha, you so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby (Ow)

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Alright, yes, he is)

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Yeah, hey)

My man is smooth like Barry and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home, he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me every time I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on cloud nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Mine'll rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mack ****
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like 7-Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cause good men are hard to find

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Uh, yeah, he's a  mighty, mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man (Ooh, alright)
What a mighty good man (Say it again now)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Uh, ooh-ooh)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Oh, I said what a mighty good man)

You know what I'm sayin'? He's a mighty, mighty good man, y'all
Y'all don't hear me, now check him out

My man gives real loving, that's why I call him killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker, 'cause that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that (I've got a good man)

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Uh, a mighty, mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man (Yeah, talk to 'em)

So this is love, or so you tell me
As you're walkin', out the door
Months go by, and I know for certain
It's not the love, I'm lookin' for
(Pre Chorus)
Some times, just for a moment
I reach out; hope you're still there
(Chorus)
Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most...
You were miles away...
(Verse 2)
It's hard to tell, what you're goin' through
You kept your feelings locked inside of you
Open your heart, and chances are
What you're feelin', I'm feelin' too
(Pre Chorus)
If only, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had

(Chorus)
Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most
You were miles away
(Verse 3)
When times were tough, and you were down and out
Who was there by your side?
Now you've gone; I'm so tired of bein' alone..
With only your promises...
(Bridge)
Lonliness just fades away
Thoughts of you; just memories
No cryin' now, for what we're missin'
Time won't forget what you meant to me
Hold me, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had
(Chorus)
Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore

World turns black and white
Pictures in an empty room
Your love starts falling down
Better change your tune
Yeah, you reach for the golden ring
You reach for the sky
Baby, just spread your wings

And get higher and higher
Straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher
Leave it all behind

Run, run, run away
Like a train runnin' off the track
Got the truth bein' left behind
Fall between the cracks
Standin' on broken dreams
Never losin' sight, ah
Well, just spread your wings

We'll get higher and higher
Straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher
Leave it all behind

So baby, dry your eyes
Save all the tears you've cried

In a world that must be strong
Oh, that's what dreams are made of

I hitched a ride with a vending machine repair man
He said he's been down this road more than twice
He was high on intellectualism
I've never been there, but the brochure looks nice

Jump in, let's go
Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low
These are the days when anything goes

Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine

He's got a daughter he calls Easter
She was born on a Tuesday night
I'm just wondering why I feel so all alone
Why I'm a stranger in my own life

Jump in, let's go
Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low
These are the days when anything goes

Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine

I've been swimmin' in a sea of anarchy
I've been livin' on coffee and nicotine
I've been wonderin' if all the things I've seen were ever real
Were ever really happening (Were ever really happening)

Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer

Sharp about everyone but yourself

A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter, listen to me

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Little precious has a natural obsession
For temptation, but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me""
One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place, y'all don't hear me

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all (Your way or no way)
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray?
I pray all ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)
Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all (I know, I know, your way, hey)
But I think you're moving too fast"

If you see a faded sign at the side of the road that says
“15 miles to the
Love Shack”
Love Shack, yeah, yeah
I'm heading down the Atlanta highway
Looking for the love getaway
Headed for the love getaway
I got me a car that's as big as a whale
And we're heading on down to the Love Shack
I got me a Chrysler that seats about 20
So hurry up and bring your jukebox money
The Love Shack is a little old place where we can get together
Love Shack, baby (a-Love Shack, baby)

Love Shack, baby, Love Shack (Love, baby, that's where it's at)
Sign says (woo!), “Stay away, fools
'Cause love rules at the Love Shack”
Well, it's set way back in the middle of a field
Just a funky old shack and I gotta get back
Glitter on the mattress
Glitter on the highway
Glitter on the front porch
Glitter on the highway

The Love Shack is a little old place where we can get together
Love Shack, baby (Love Shack, baby)

Dancing and a-loving
Wearing next to nothing
'Cause it's hot as an oven

When everybody's moving around
And around and around and around
Everybody's moving, everybody's grooving, baby

Everybody's moving, everybody's grooving, baby

Hop in my Chrysler, it's as big as a whale, and it's about to set sail

People livin' their lives for you on TV
They say they're better than you and you agree
He says, ""Hold my calls from behind those cold brick walls""
Says, ""Come here boys, there ain't nothing for free""
Another doctor's bill, a lawyer's bill, another cute cheap thrill
You know you love him if you put him in your will, but

Who will save your souls when it comes to the flowers now?
Who, who will save your souls after those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save your souls if you won't save your own?
La dee-dee-da, dee-da, dee-da-da, da-la-da

We try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss 'em
And the cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue
Another day, another dollar, another war
Another tower went up where the homeless had their homes
So we pray to as many different Gods as there are flowers
But we call religion our friend
We're so worried about saving our souls
Afraid that God will take His toll that we forget to begin, but

Who will save your soul when it comes to the babies now?
Who, who will save your soul after all those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save your soul if you won't save your own?
La dee-dee-da, dee-da, dee-da-da, da-la-da

Some are walking, some are talking, some are stalking their kill
Got social security but it doesn't pay your bills
There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay
So you bargain with the Devil, but you're okay for today, say
That you love them, take their money and run
Say it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just one of those things
Those flings, those strings you've got to cut
So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts

Who will save-ave your soul when it comes to the babies?
Oh, who will save your souls after those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save-ave your souls if you won't save your own?"

Once upon a time, not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love

She says, ""We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot""

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
""Baby, it's okay
Someday""

We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love

You can push it for more mileage, but your flaps are wearing thin
And I could sleep on it 'til mornin', but this nightmare never ends
Don't forget to call my lawyers with ridiculous demands
An' you can take the pity so far, but it's more than I can stand

And I got to, got to know

This we must leave and get undone
We must engage and rearrange
And turn this planet back to one
So tell me why we got to die
And kill each other one by one
We've got to hug and rub-a-dub

So long ago, I don't remember when
That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well, they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees

I seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste, she always had a pretty face
So I wondered why she hung around this place

Hey

Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We'll put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight

She said, ""It's cold, it feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade""
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed

And I seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge
Saying all there's good and nothingness is dead
We'll run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothing left
She hit the end, it's just her window ledge

Hey

Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight


Well, this place is old, it feels just like a beat-up truck
I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
What smells of cheap wine, cigarettes
This place is always such a mess
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn

I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between
The city walls of dying dreams
I think her death, it must be killing me

Hey, hey, hey

Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight"

To cool the night for you and I

Through fields to feast my eyes upon

The loving cup of burning sun

In dreams I'll crave familiar taste
Of whispered rain on weary face
Of kisses sweet and warm embrace
Another time, another place

One, two princes kneel before you
That's what I said now
Princes, princes who adore you
Just go ahead now
One has diamonds in his pockets
And that's some bread now
This one who wants to buy you rockets
Ain't in his head now

Marry him, or marry me
I'm the one that loves you, baby, can't you see?
I ain't got no future or family tree
But I know what a prince and lover ought to be
I know what a prince and lover ought to be

Said
If you want to call me ""baby""

And if you would like to tell me ""maybe""
Just go ahead now

Talk to me softly, there's something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow and please don't cry
I know how you feel inside, I've, I've been there before
Something is changing inside you and don't you know?

Don't you cry tonight, I still love you, baby
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight

Give me a whisper and give me a sigh
Give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now and please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinking of you and the times we had, baby

And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight


And please remember that I never lied, oh
And please remember how I felt inside now, honey
You gotta make it your own way but you'll be alright now, sugar
You'll feel better tomorrow, come the morning light now, baby

And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby

Brother Pele's in the back, sweet Sina's in the front
Cruising down the freeway in the hot, hot sun
Suddenly red-blue lights flash us from behind
Loud voice booming, ""Please step out onto the line""
Pele preaches words of comfort, Sina just hides her eyes
Policeman taps his shades, ""Is that a Chevy '69?""

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre

Destination unknown as we pull in for some gas
A freshly pasted poster reveals a smile from the past
Elephants and acrobats, lions, snakes, monkey
Pele speaks ""righteous,"" Sister Sina says, ""funky""

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre
Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)
It's making me crazy (It's making me crazy)
Every time I look around (Look around)
Every time I look around (Every time I look around)
Every time I look around
It's in my face

Ringmaster steps out, says, ""The elephants left town""
People jump and jive and the clowns have stuck around
TV news and cameras, there's choppers in the sky
Marines, police, reporters ask where, for and why
Pele yells, ""We're out of here,"" Sina says, ""Right on""
Making moves and starting grooves before they knew we were gone
Jumped into the Chevy, headed for big lights
Wanna know the rest? Hey, buy the rights

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre
Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)

There's no sign on the gate

Think of all the bubbles of love we made

And you're down on your knees

Oh, don't come crawlin'
And you lie by my feet
What a big mistake
I see you fallin'

Got a buzz in my head
And my flowers are dead
Can't figure out a way to rectify this situation
Don't believe what you said

And you're down on your knees

Careful how you treat me

And I don't know if I can do it

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosin' my confessions
Tryin' to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now, I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight

You say to me I don't talk enough

You can ask us
Pushing down the relative
Bringing out your higher self
Think of the fine times, pushing
Down the better few, instead of
Bringing out the clues, to what the
World and everything anger to, brace
Yourself with the grace of ease
I know this world ain't what it seems

Now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw

Hope that I'm talking allegorically
Know that I'm talking by the way I feel

And I've never known a girl like you before

Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye
I never dreamed it could be over
I never wanted to say goodbye

Looking back over my shoulder
With an aching deep in my heart
I wish we were starting over
Oh, instead of drifting so far apart

Everybody told me you were leaving
Funny I should be the last to know
Baby, please tell me that I'm dreaming
I just never want to let you go

Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye
Turning my heart over and over
I never wanted to say goodbye

I don't mind everybody laughing
But it's enough to make a grown man cry
'Cause I can feel you slipping through my fingers
I don't even know the reason why


Every day it's a losing battle
Just to smile and hold my head up high
Could it be that we belong together
Baby, won't you give me one more try?
One more try

Looking back over my shoulder (Over my shoulder)

Only feels much stronger, I wanna love you longer

So if I love you a little more than I should

Made breath and skin, I've been waiting for you
Signed, with a home tattoo
Happy birthday to you was created for you

Oh, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime
To come undone now

We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me in to cry

Who do you need? Who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need? Who do you love
When you come undone?

Words, playing me déjà vu
Like a radio tune, I swear I've heard before
Chills, is it something real
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers?
(Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams)
(Can not believe you're taking my heart to pieces)
Lost, in a snow filled sky
We'll make it alright
To come undone now

We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me in to cry

You are not alone, and how long can you run?
It's much too late if you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Once upon a time you were a child, but that was yesterday
Believed that magic in your heart would never fade away
But hold your head up high, and let your spirits fly
Keep hope alive, yes, deep inside, and your dreams will never die

We are one
Everywhere I go, everyone I see
And I see my face looking back at me
We are one
Everything I know, what I know is true
Everyone of us is inside of you
We are one
We are one

Oooh, take a breath, close your eyes, you're on the road again
And then you realize they've brought you back to life again
Some things never change, but if you fantasize
You'll feel it deep inside yourself, and then you'll realize
When you feel it coming
When you hear the sound
You'll always laugh when you wanna cry
And then you'll know it deep inside

We are one
Everywhere I go, everyone I see
And I see my face looking back at me

I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers?
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (Dream away)
In the wind of change
Mmm

Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

On a glory night (A glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (Share their dreams)
With you and me (With you and me)

Blows straight into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring the freedom bell
For peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say (Say)

Excite the middle between the two poles
The globe rotates from new to old

Narrow mind clydes (suckers!), still holding a pose
To what we pour 'n flow when we come close
To the contrary, they pinch their earlobes
They call it rogue-rock, but it's a deeper shade of soul

We blend everythin', with the color of skin
Under the skin, we're in like Flynn
Ducks stare at us, as soon as we begin
To innovate the frame of thought they are in
Again, music's got to do with only feeling
It's not where you're from, it's ""Can they yield in?""
The stuff we rock and that we are giving
A piece of the mind connects with rhythm

Oh, girl dancin' down those dirty and dusty trails
Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
Around the world, the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings, without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Skip the airstrip to the sunset
Yeah, ride the arrow to the target one
Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
Around the world, the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings, without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel


Fly the great big sky, see the great big sea
Kick through continents, bustin' boundaries
Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
Around the world, the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings, without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
Oh boy
Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
Ow

The glamour boys swear they are a diva
The glamour boys have it all under control
Always dancing, always laughing
The glamour boys are playing the role

The glamour boys never have no money
The glamour boys wear the most expensive clothes
The glamour boys are always at the party
Where the money comes from heaven only knows

I ain't no glamour boy (I'm fierce!)
I ain't no glamour boy (Whoo!)
I ain't no glamour boy (I'm fierce!)
I ain't no glamour boy

The glamour boys live off their ambition
The glamour boys have it all figured out
A very, very dubious position
When you got no clout

The glamour boys' whole life is a gamble
They might get over or fall flat on their face
But if one does, there's no need to worry
Another G-Boy will take his place

I ain't no glamour boy (I'm fierce!)
I ain't no glamour boy (Whoo!)
I ain't no glamour boy (I'm fierce!)
I ain't no glamour boy

The glamour boys don't think about tomorrow
The glamour boys just need tonight to play
But just like things you can't afford on credit
Time catches up and you have to pay

The glamour boys are always on the guest list
You'll always find them in the hottest spots in town
They'll be your friend if you have fame or fortune
If you don't they won't be hanging 'round

I ain't no glamour boy (I'm fierce!)
I ain't no glamour boy (Whoo!)
I ain't no glamour boy (I'm fierce!)
I ain't no glamour boy, yeah, yeah

I ain't no glamour boy (I'm fierce!)

Don't talk to me about heroes

Or so call mean bad man
Or that's just down to the strain

Riding on any wave
That is the luck you crave
They don't believe it now
They just think it's stupid
So got anything?
Anyone could have done
Who would've cared at all?
Not you

Another heart has made the trade
Forget it, forget it, forget it
I don't understand how a heart is a spade
But somehow, the vital connection is made

Riding on anything
Anything's good enough
Who would've thought it of
Someone like you?
Just as they brought me round
Now that they brought you down
Roundabout and roundabout
Who wants a life anyway?

Another heart has made the grade
Forget it, forget it, forget it

But somehow, the vital connection is made"

My, my, my, my music hits me so hard
Makes me say ""Oh my Lord""
Thank you for blessin' me with a mind to rhyme and two hype feet
It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

I told you, homeboy (You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we livin' and ya know (You can't touch this)
Look in my eyes, man (You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics (You can't touch this)

Fresh new kicks and pants
You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin', hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission, so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch

Yo, I told you (You can't touch this)
Why you standin' there, man? (You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school's in, sucker (You can't touch this)

Give me a song or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' 'bout the Hammer, you're talkin' 'bout a show
That's hyped and tight
Singers are sweatin', so pass them a wipe
Or a tape to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

That's word because you know (You can't touch this)

Go with the flow, it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave yo' hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump

Look, man (You can't touch this)

I'll take you higher, higher
I'll take you higher, higher
I'll take you higher, higher
I'll take you higher, higher

Take a toke slow or you might choke
I got the best love you ever smoked
Take a toke, but baby it's no joke
So strong it will make you choke

Spark up the love you need in me, in me
Roll it up tight lightly and don't let any fall down
Get rid of the slight debris between you and me
'Cause we don't need any bad seeds (Listen)
Cause all of my life, baby
I've been living kinda trife, sugar
No one to guide me through and
Day and night without a clue
And I really need someone
To point me in the right direction
Swing my way, parley parley
Prove my point that I am the joint

Take a toke slow or you might choke
I got the best love you ever smoked
Take a toke, but baby it's no joke
So strong it will make you choke

There's no need to try to front on you, on you
I'd rather be blunt this much is true
Slide to the room, let's hit the boom, babe
So supersonic once you get to taste the chronic
More than you'll ever need
You ignite me and I'll ignite you
And once all the sheets burn, baby
I've got some more bambu
And when the smoke clears
Lady, still my eyes focus on you
Huff-n-puff some of my funk stuff
Prove my point that I am the joint
You know I'm the joint

Take a toke slow or you might choke
I got the best love you ever smoked
Take a toke, but baby it's no joke
So strong it will make you choke

I like it (I like it)
I love it (I love it)
I need it (I need it)
I want it (I want it)
Got to have it (Got to have it)
I like it, I love it
I need it, I want it
Got to have it

Take a toke slow or you might choke
I got the best love you ever smoked
Take a toke slow or you might choke
I got the best love you ever smoked
Take a toke, but baby it's no joke
So strong it will make you choke

Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye
I never dreamed it could be over
I never wanted to say goodbye

Looking back over my shoulder
With an aching deep in my heart
I wish we were starting over
Oh, instead of drifting so far apart

Everybody told me you were leaving
Funny I should be the last to know
Baby, please tell me that I'm dreaming
I just never want to let you go

Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye
Turning my heart over and over
I never wanted to say goodbye

I don't mind everybody laughing
But it's enough to make a grown man cry
'Cause I can feel you slipping through my fingers
I don't even know the reason why


Every day it's a losing battle
Just to smile and hold my head up high
Could it be that we belong together
Baby, won't you give me one more try?
One more try

Looking back over my shoulder (Over my shoulder)
(I can see) See that look in your eye (That look in your eye)
(I never dreamed) It could be over (It could be over)
But I never wanted to say goodbye (But I never wanted to say goodbye)

(Looking back) Looking back (Over my shoulder)
Oh, with an aching (There's an aching) Feeling inside (Feeling inside)
(Cutting me up) Oh, deeper and deeper (Deeper and deeper)
(Fills me with a sadness) I can't hide (I can't hide)

Yo, man
Yo
Open up, man
Yo, what you want, man?
My girl just caught me
You made her catch you?
I don't know how I let this happen
With who?
The girl next door, ya know?
Man...
I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

How come you gave the women accеss to your villa?
Trespass and witnessing the hacklin’ of your pillow
You bеtter watch your back before she turn into a killer
You best review the situation that you’re caught up inna
To be a true player you must know how to play
If she say it was in the night, convince her that it’s the day
Never admit to a word that she says
And if she claims it’s you tell her “Baby, no way”

But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?

Let her know she really has no reason to be vexed
It’s never you she saw making the gigolo flex
It was someone that resembles you in the complex
Seein’ is believing so you better change your specs
You know she's going to bring up a lot of things up from the past
All the little evidence, you better know to mask
Quick on your answers, know how to talk
But if she packs a gun, you know you better run fast

But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wa-wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

Wanna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin'
It makes no sense at all
Need to tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
That's why I sing

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me"

I've got a new-age girl (Tell us what she's like)
An environmentalist girl (Does she ride a bike?)
She has a crystal necklace (Does she spend a lot of cash?)
Though her vibes are rather reckless (She's heading for a crash)
Oh, her flowing skirt is blowing in a transcendental wind
And she wonders without knowing, ""Where did we begin?""

She don't eat meat, but she sure like the bone

You know she drives a wind car (How does she like it?)
It doesn't get her far (Why she doesn't bike it?)
But it gets her to where she's going to (I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)
Where that is, I wish I knew
I don't know where she's going and I don't know where she's been
All I know that lovin' her has got to be a sin

In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food skulls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

The forces of evil and a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat, for the body, for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax fallin' on a termite
Who's chokin' on the splinters

(*Whistling*)

I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
(*Whistling*)

The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers?
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (Dream away)
In the wind of change
Mmm

Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

Take me (Take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (A glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (Share their dreams)
With you and me (With you and me)
Take me (Take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (A glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (Dream away)
In the wind of change (The wind of change)

The wind of change
Blows straight into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring the freedom bell
For peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say (Say)


Take me (Take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (A glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (Share their dreams)
With you and me (With you and me)
Take me (Take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (A glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (Dream away)
In the wind of change (The wind of change)

Ready to go
Ready to go

You're weird, in tears
Too near and too far away
He said, ""saw red""
Went home, stayed in bed all day
Your t-shirt, dish dirt
Always love the one you hurt

It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops shouting out
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back and ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out
It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops having it
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back and ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out
Shout it out

You sleep too deep
One week is another world
(Big mouth) Big mouth
(Drop out) Drop out
You get what you deserve
You're strange, insane
One thing you can never change

It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops shouting out
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back and ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out
It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops having it
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back and ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out
Shout it out

Ready to go
Abused, confused
Always love the one
That hurt ya, hurt ya, hurt ya, hurt ya

It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops shouting out
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back and ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out
It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops having it
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back and ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out

It's a crack
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go"
