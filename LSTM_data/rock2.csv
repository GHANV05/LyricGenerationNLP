Half-past twelve
And I'm watchin' the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowin' outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm livin' in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight


There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day"

Bright light city gonna set my soul
Gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher
There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
And they're all living the devil may care
And I'm just a devil with love to spare
So Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas

How I wish that there were more
Than the 24 hours in the day
Even if there were 40 more
I wouldn't sleep a minute away
Oh, there's blackjack and poker and the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on every deal
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas

Viva Las Vegas with you neon flashing
And your one arm bandits crashing
All those hopes down the drain
Viva Las Vegas, turning day into nighttime
Turning night into daytime
If you see it once
You'll never be the same again

I'm gonna keep on the run, I'm gonna have me some fun
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke, oh well, I'll always remember
That I had a swinging time
I'm gonna give it everything I've got
Lady luck please let the dice stay hot
Let me shoot a seven with every shot
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas

They say I’m different 'cause I’m a piece of sugar cane
Sweet to the core, that’s why I got rhythm
My great grandma didn’t like the foxtrot
Nah, instead she’d spit her snuff and boogie to Elmore James
They say I’m different 'cause I eat chitlins
I can’t help it I was born and raised on’em, that’s right
Every mornin' I'd have to slop the hogs
And they’d be gettin’ off humpin’ to John Lee Hooker
They say I’m different 'cause I’m a piece of sugar cane
And when I kick my legs, I got rhythm
My great grandpa was a blues lover
He’d be rockin’ his moonshine to B.B. King and Jimmy Reed
Rock on now

And that’s why they say I’m different
And that’s why they say I’m strange

I’m talkin bout Big Momma Thornton

I'm going 'round back, said she'd meet me there
We were rollin' in the grass that grows behind the barn
When my ears started ringin' like a fire alarm

The way they wiggle that thing really knocks me out
I'm gettin' high all the time, hope you all are too
C'mon little closer, gonna do it to you

Whoo

Well, the South side of Chicago is the baddest part of town
And if you go down there, you better just beware
Of a man named Leroy Brown
Now, Leroy, more than trouble
You see, he stands, about, six foot four
All the downtown ladies call him ""Treetop Lover""
All the men just call him ""Sir"" (Right on)

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

Now, Leroy, he's a gambler
And he likes his fancy clothes
And he liked to wave his diamond rings in front of everybody's nose
He got a custom Continental
He got an Eldorado too
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Well, Friday, about, a week ago
Leroy's shooting dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named Doris
And, ooh, that girl looked nice
Well, he casts his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
Leroy Brown, he learned a lesson about messing
With the wife of a jealous man

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Well, the two men took to fighting
And when they pulled them from the floor
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle with a couple of pieces gone

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog
And he’s bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Yeah, he was badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog"

Oh, get on up

I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia, California on my mind
I straddled that Greyhound and rode him into Raleigh and on across Caroline

We had motor trouble that turned into a struggle halfway across Alabam'
Well, the 'Hound broke down and left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

Right away, I bought me a through train ticket, riding across Mississippi clean
I was on that Midnight Flyer out of Birmingham, smoking into New Orleans

Somebody help me get out of Louisiana, just help me get to Houston town
There are people there who care a little about me and they won't let the poor boy down

Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit and put luggage in my hand
And I woke up high over Albuquerque on a jet to the promised land

A-workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte, flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes he would set us at the terminal gate

Swing low, chariot, come down easy, taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings and let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia, tidewater four-ten-o-nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling and the poor boy is on the line

A-workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte, flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes he would set us at the terminal gate

Swing low, chariot, come down easy, taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings and let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia, tidewater four-ten-o-nine

With life in place, the chains are on a countdown to break. Artificial condition known as life
Destruction! The origin of a destructive path. An obscure destructive path. Artificial condition
Pathetic intelligence. Pathetic intelligence has been injected into the selected beings. Their minds are connected, but rarely directеd. Negatively affectеd, all due to the pain of being completely neglected
Confined and withering into the abyss
An obscure path that never mattered. Like bloody glass that’s been shattered
It’s melting through the hands of the useless souls. Useless souls
This imaginary earth that no one truly controls. Controls!
Fear for the sky, where the blood is collected. Where the blood is collected
One by one, they were all wired into the thought of terror
Watching the earth melt through the hands of the weak as they are all isolated in fear
Now no words remain for those who have never had the chance to complain
A slave they remain, with nothing to gain. A slave they remain, with nothing to gain. Placed into the sky for their blood to rain... to rain
This reality; beyond insane. Beyond insane!
Forcefully thrown in, and forcefully erased. Forcefully thrown in, and forcefully erased. With no choice but to be forgotten. The sky was meant to rest the ones that are well past rotten. Forcefully thrown in
There is no way to return. The time will come. The fragile world will grow feeble
Inevitable! Inevitable, but mandatory to live in fear of this territory. Live in fear of this territory

Sight from the top, with so much height that won’t stop. Fiction or constriction?
A thought so aggressive, has conformed into addiction. A thought so aggressive, has conformed into addiction. Forced! Not to be taken for granted. Forced! Not to be taken for granted. Walk this earth while you can. I think good
Those with control will obliterate the weak. Those with control will obliterate the weak
As the prosthetic souls enter their bodies, the world will shake
With life in place, the chains are on a countdown to break. A countdown to break. Artificial condition known as life
Weakness will reveal with the inability to determine what’s real. What’s real!
Control must be earned. Power must be taken, in order to reawaken
The weak into power. The power into control. The control turned to rage
This war has just begun! This hatred built from power. A desire to kill
Their lives are flashing back for their final hour. Nothing could have changed this circumstance
Run as far as you can, but they will all collapse regardless. They will all collapse
Desire for the throne, the weak have no right to remain conscious
One by one, they will be set free
One by one, they will be set free and join the nonexistent entity
A dishonorable defeat. The fear is constantly racing through their minds. They keep running, but eventually there will be no place left to hide
No place left to hide. Surpassing the misery and endless images of horror that was once unimaginable
No place left to hide. Surpassing the misery
No place left to hide. Surpassing the misery of horror that was once unimaginable
It has become a traumatizing reality. Trauma! Trauma! It has become a traumatizing reality

Pathetic intelligence has been injected into the selected beings. Their minds are connected, but rarely directed. Negatively affected, all due to the pain of being completely neglected
The dark will never end. The light was but a dream. The light was but a dream
Only to be heard. It is all just a dream. Never to be true. Never to be true
The cowards hit the bottom
The cowards hit the bottom as their blood runs through the cracks on the floor
Finally, what’s inside the skull is connected to the earth
Finally, what’s inside the skull is connected to the earth
Only then will they realize that this world has been hopeless
Sinking. Sinking. They’re all sinking. Sinking into corruption. Sinking into insanity
Nothing was meant to be. Nothing was meant to be fair
Driven by the neglect. Driven by the neglect
The world will shake. The world will shake
Inevitable, but mandatory to live in fear of this territory
The world will shake. The world will shake
Restless eyes forced open to observe. To observe
Restless eyes forced open to observe and indulge in the Hell on this earth. A pointless earth for the ones who have fallen. This is suffering. Years of suffering. Fear! Pain!
With nothing to gain, the superior will reign. Death!
No way to numb the suffering. No way to numb the suffering
The pain won’t... The pain won’t go away. Away!
Accepting defeat is only the beginning of pain... of pain!
Their limbs so frail. Their flesh so pale
All of the recent torment is here to stay
All of the recent torment and shock has caused this distress. Nothing left to regret, nothing left to regret, just embrace the pain that you will never forget
Accepting defeat is only the beginning of pain... of pain!
Their limbs so frail. Their flesh so pale
All of the recent torment... is here to stay
Overrated. Unrelated. Our race overpopulated. Frail!
Their limbs so frail. Their limbs so frail. Their flesh so pale
All of the recent torment is here to stay
No way to numb the suffering
An overrated humanity, designed to be wasted until time depletes. As time depletes

Break these chains. No way to numb
As the prosthetic souls enter their bodies, the world will shake
With life in place, the chains are on a countdown to break. Artificial condition known as life
Artificial condition, a false reality
Artificial condition, a false reality
Fear for the sky, where the blood is collected. Where the blood is collected
One by one, they were all wired into the thought of terror
Resorting to chaos. A solution so pure. The race designed for worms
The race designed for filthy worms
Pathetic and worthless dreamlike state of mind
Consuming all of the irrelevant sensations. Consuming all, until there is nothing
Replacing lives with more lives. Replacing lives with no lives. Animalistic tendencies absorbing all
Replacing lives with more lives. Replacing lives with no lives. Animalistic tendencies absorbing all
Dispose all of the senseless and miserable individuals
Dispose all of the senseless. A solution so pure. So pure
Pathetic and worthless dreamlike state of mind
Deception at its finest
Resorting to chaos. A solution so pure. The race designed for worms
Don’t question the walls beneath your fragile skin. Unbearable is all that’s known on this Hell
Destined to break. Destined to break! Break!
Beyond contorted with no solution
They’ll be trapped forever as the blood they shed is poured out from the heart, into their coffin
Devour and destroy the cowards. The beginning of a wasteland for those who don’t listen
Ignorant as can be, a brainwashed society
The vulnerable will never be prepared to enter the burial ground. Ground
The thought of the inevitable plans are bleak and desirable
The disconnection of this filthy atmosphere has left uncertainty, and desperation
Ignorant as can be, a brainwashed society
The vulnerable will never be prepared to enter the burial ground
They’ll be trapped forever as the blood they shed is poured out from the heart, into their coffin
Watch them fall apart
So it goes to show, the superior will reign. Reign Hell forever
To indulge in showing absolutely no remorse, is what defines the craved satisfaction
Reign! Reign! Reign Hell forever! Reign Hell!
Temper so vile. Inflicting endless pain
Reign Hell forever! Inflicting endless pain
Tortured forever. Reign Hell forever!
Prosthetic soul, break these chains! Exit this body once and for all!"

We're barefootin'

Threw away her wig, and her high sneakers, too
She was doin' a dance without any shoes

She was barefootin'
She was barefootin'

Hey, little girl with your red dress on
I bet you can barefoot all night long
Take off your shoes and throw 'em away
Come back and get 'em another day

We're barefootin'
We're barefootin'
We're barefootin'

Everybody get barefootin'
Take off your shoes

Li'l John Henry, he said to Sue
""If I was barefootin' would you barefoot, too""?
Sue told John, ""I'll stir your stew
I was barefootin' ever since I was two""

We'll get to know each other if we can

She said, hey - just a little bit - hold on

To feel it for the first time, was it really such a thrill?

That ain't much - it's only a school boy crush

Got to keep this secret - I can't take no chance
Don't want nobody else to know
There is nothing wrong with trying to start a romance
We should take it nice and slow
If we play it cool (If we play it cool), it'll be all right
Don't let the teacher see us talking
But after school we can be out of sight
Everybody gonna think we just gone walkin'

Can't you hear them talkin' about it
Together we could race the breeze
It shines out a light, in the darkest night
To make us feel alright
To make us feel alright
I've prayed every night
That you will wanna go there too
Come on darlin', let's go
Night is over as the dawn begins to crack
Sounds like a hen hatching in a chicken shack
Late last night I think I heard a lonely cry
Heard the blind owl howling in a moonlit sky

Come on
Won't you be there when it leaves
Can't ya hear me talkin'
Together we could race the breeze
Old engine driver never stepped on the ground
Got no degree in geography but he's been around
Knows all the back lines, eyes can hardly see
Don't tell this man to slow down
'Cause he don't know what you mean
Alright
Won't you be there when it leaves
Can't you hear me cryin' honey
Together we can race the breeze
It shines out a light, in the darkest night
To make us feel alright
To make us feel alright
I've prayed every night
That you will wanna go there too
Well that sounds like the night train, blowin' its stack
Spreading its wheels on homeward track
Arrived here this morning, won't be long
As fast as a shooting star, that's' what them eight wheels are for

Together we can race the breeze
Can't you hear me talkin' baby
We can race the breeze
Don't you hear me talkin' honey
We can race the breeze
Hear me talkin' baby
We can race the breeze"

If you're feeling alright
Right, alright already

Lord, make my car go heavy
Give me gold and plenty
Man, I love your city
Alright

I need your loving
So be my lover
And I'll stop rambling
What's a cowboy to do now
From California
When he's lost and he's rambling
In Austin, Texas?

I was born in a filthy dump
My mother died, my daddy got drunk
And they left me here, yes, to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road
I grew up in prefabricated shack
When I went to high school
They pulled the clothes off my back
Lord above knows how much I loathe
This mean old place called Tobacco Road, yes
Tobacco Road, let me tell you now, Tobacco Road
Talking ’bout a road yeah, Tobacco Road, Lord
Talking ’bout your road, talking ’bout my road
Talking ’bout Tobacco Road, talking ’bout a road
But it’s home, hmm, yes it is
The only life I’ve ever known, I’ve ever known
And the Lord knows how much I loathe
Tobacco Road, road, road, road, road (road, road, road)
Talking ’bout your road (road, road, road)
Talking ’bout my road (road, road, road)
You know, baby (road, road, road)
I left my home, yeah (road, road, road)
Because it’s dirty and it’s filthy (road, road, road)
You know it’s crawling with rats, and stinking with lice (road, road, road)
But it’s home, yes it is (road, road, road)
I tell you what I’m gonna do (road, road, road)
I tell you what I’m gonna do (road, road, road)

Oh I’m gonna leave and I'll get a job
And with the help and the grace from above
I’ll get meself money at the whip, get rich I know
And ship it all back to Tobacco Road, yes I will
I will I’ll bring dynamite, and I’ll bring me a crane
And I’ll blow it all up, tear it down, start all over again
And I’ll build me a town, people, I’ll be brought to top, yes I will
I’ll be crackin’ soul, Lord he knows
I’ll be crackin’ soul yes, I will
And I’ll keep the name yes yes yes
Come on never forget me, people, aaaah
Road, road
Talkin’ ’bout a road yeah
Talkin’ ’bout your road
Ttalkin’ ’bout my road
Talkin’ ’bout Tobacco Road
You know I’m talkin’ about it
I’m tellin’ you about it
Talkin’ about it
It’s gotta be changed
It’s got to be changed
I’ve got to change it


I have a dream
Everybody has a dream
I have a dream
That I can change it
I have a dream
That I can make it good once more
I have a dream, it’s mine and yours and mine and yours
Let me tell you ’bout my dream
Let me tell you ’bout my dream
We gotta to get it out
We have to build it up
Tear it down
Build it up
I had a dream one night
I had a dream one night
I was taken to a place far away
From Tobacco Road
Far away
Far away from you
Far away from myself
I had a dream
I had a dream
Up above my head
I saw something
It was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen
In my life
I spoke out loud
I said
You know you are the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life
I heard a voice tell me
I heard a voice say to me
It said “What do you want?”
I said “I want to change it
Because it’s wrong
I want to change it
Because I believe it can be better”
The voice said to me
“What makes you think
That you are man enough
To change anything?”
I thought for awhile
And then I spoke out loud
And I said to it
I said...
“Because I am a man
And I am a part of the things that are wrong
And if this world must go on
I have to put it right
And I know
Just by lookin’ at you, baby
That you’re superior to me
And you can help me
Give me the answers
Give me some answers”
She turned around to me
You know what she said
She said “I can help you
But there’s something I want from you, is a gift
In return
For the information I can give
I want a gift from you
I want a gift from you
I tried my very best to look up to the sky
And then I realized I had no eyes
I was blind
Totally blind
I begin to get afraid
Afraid of the dark
I was afraid
Afraid in the darkness
But then I thought about my friends
Who have no eyesight
I thought about the world they live in
And how much it’s nice there
How good it made me feel
I was not afraid
I was not afraid anymore
I spoke up louder
I said “Listen
You’ve got my eyesight
There isn’t much more I can give
Now tell me, how do I change it?”
The voice said back
“Oh yes there is
We want something more than your eyesight”
I thought for a while
And I thought
“What more could she want than my eyes?”
And then the terrible feeling crept over me
As I began to realize that I understood what she was talkin' 'bout
I screamed out loud!
Said “I’m not-a-give up my life!
I’d love to give you my life
But I’m just a young man
And I have a wife
I have a wife and a baby
And if I die
I know they’ll cry
So please don’t take my life
Then I heard my wife say
“It’s all right baby
I understand
Go ahead and do your thing!”
There was nowhere I could run
I heard my father say
“I understand son
Go ahead and give it
It’s yours to give.”
Then I heard my mother say the same thing
She said
“Go ahead and give it away
I gave to you
And now it’s yours to give to someone else”
I was lost
I was lost
No place to run, no place to hide
No place to run no place to hide
I felt it
I knew it
I could sense it
I could feel it
Creeping up from the tips of my toes
Up my legs
Over my knees
Up over my belly
'Cross my chest
The black shadow
Of death
No place to run, no place to hide
So I just laid there and I died
Died, died
Darkness, stillness

But it’s gotta be change, yes it has
It’s gotta be change, yes it has
I opened my eyes once more
I breathe again, I walked again
I was ten times stronger
They give it back to me
I’m gonna give it back to you
Life is too precious
Life is priceless
Life goes on and on and, Lord
Never stops
Never stops, no no
It just goes on and on and on and on and on
I’ve got to change that road
I gotta build me a new road
We can walk that road together
Hand in hand, yes
Hand in hand, ah
Hand in hand, people, aww, yeah

Road, road, ha-ha
Talkin’ ’bout a road, yeah

You may find yourself
Living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself
In another part of the world
And you may find yourself
Behind the wheel of a large automobile
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house
With a beautiful wife
And you may ask yourself
""Well ... how did I get here?""

Letting the days go by
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by
Water flowing underground
Into the blue again
After the money's gone
Once in a lifetime
Water flowing underground
And you may ask yourself
""How do I work this?""
And you may ask yourself
""Where is that large automobile?""
And you may tell yourself
""This is not my beautiful house!""
And you may tell yourself
""This is not my beautiful wife!""

Letting the days go by
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by
Water flowing underground
Into the blue again
After the money's gone
Once in a lifetime
Water flowing underground

Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was

Water dissolving, and water removing
There is water at the bottom of the ocean
Under the water, carry the water
Remove the water at the bottom of the ocean
Water dissolving, and water removing

Letting the days go by
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by
Water flowing underground
Into the blue again
Into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones
There is water underground
Letting the days go by
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by
Water flowing underground
Into the blue again
After the money's gone
Once in a lifetime
Water flowing underground

You may ask yourself
""What is that beautiful house?""
You may ask yourself
""Where does that highway go to?""
And you may ask yourself
""Am I right? Am I wrong?""
And you may say to yourself
""My God! What have I done?!""

Letting the days go by
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by
Water flowing underground
Into the blue again
Into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones
There is water underground
Letting the days go by
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by
Water flowing underground
Into the blue again
After the money's gone
Once in a lifetime
Water flowing underground

Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it, ever was
And look where my hand was
Time isn't holding up
Time isn't after us
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was

Letting the days go by

And here, a twister comes, here comes the twister

I called the teacher cause I wanted to confess it now
Can I make the time for me to come and get it blessed somehow
She spoke to me in such a simple and decisive tone
Her sweet admission left me feeling in position from

I don't take these things so personal, anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible, anymore

Somebody hooted and they hollered, ""Can I buy a vowel""
Don't let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel
And when it's not as it appears to be, the flagrant foul
Can I put my fingers in your mouth before you start to growl

I don't think that it's so terrible, anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable, anymore

Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin

Sometimes I feel like I'm a sentimental trooper
She cried so hard, you know she looked like Alice Cooper

I don't think that it's so personal, anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible, anymore

Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin

I'm kissin' high and low, our bodies like two dominoes
Can I come and get you when I hit you in your party clothes
Let's turn this cosplay holiday, what we obey
And now we're welcoming each other to this cabaret

I don't think that it's so terrible, anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable, anymore

Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin

I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding
Opened the door up and to my surprise, there, you were standing
Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar?
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
And I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never, ne-ne-never
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much"

About working all summer
Just to try to earn a dollar

Try to get a date

You gotta work late”

Sometimes I wonder
What I'm a-gonna do
But there ain't no cure
For the summertime blues

Well, my mama and papa told me
“Son, you gotta make some money
If you wanna use the car
To go a-riding next Sunday”
Well, I didn't go to work
Told the boss I was sick
“Now you can't use the car
'Cause you didn't work a lick”

Sometimes I wonder
What I'm a-gonna do
But there ain't no cure
For the summertime blues

I'm gonna take two weeks
Gonna have a fine vacation
I'm gonna take my problem
To the United Nations
Well, I called my congressman
And he said, quote:
“I'd like to help you, son
But you're too young to vote”

Sometimes I wonder

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called ""life""
Electric word, life
It means forever, and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else:
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-All-Right
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, babe
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor)
Whoo

If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see, I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
""Ah, ah,"" is all I heard

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go
Come..

We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for? (What's it all for?)
You better live now
'Fore the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go

C'mon, baby
Let's get nuts
Yeah
(Crazy)
Let's go crazy

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go
Go (Go crazy)
Whoo!

I said let's go crazy (Go crazy)
Let's go (Let's go)
Go (Let's go)

Dr. Everything'll-Be-All-Right
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough, children
He's coming
He's coming
Coming

It's just me and the boys

And come on up to the Mothership

Hustle on over here

Face it even your memory banks
Have forgotten this funk

Home of the p. funk, the bomb

Doin' it in 3D
Let me put on my sunglasses here
So I can see what I'm doing

When you hear seats rumble
You will hear your conscience grumble
Hit me, you gotta hit the band
You have overcome for I am here

Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride

Are you hip to Easter Island?
The Bermuda Triangle?
Well, all right
Ain't nothing but a party

Starchild here, citizens of the universe
I bring forth to you
The good time on the mothership
Are you hip? Sing, fellas


Starchild here, doin' it in 3D
So good, it's good to me
Hit the band

Coming forth to carry you home


Swing low, time to move on

Free your mind and come fly

Watchin' flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from payin' dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues. Yeh!
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today
She said her name was Billy Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
""Go on, my friend, do anything you choose.""
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billy Jean was waitin' when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
He just might find himself out there on horseback in the dark
Just ridin' and runnin' across those desert sands"

They turned the spotlight way down low, woah, woah
Little Egypt came out strutting
Wearing nothing but a button and a bow, woah, woah
Singing, “Ying-yang! Ying-yang! Ah, gitch, gitchee, gitchee, ying-yang! Ying-yang!”
She had a ruby on her tummy and
A diamond big as Texas on her toe, woah, woah
She let her hair down and
She did the hoochie-koochie real slow, woah, woah
When she did her special number on a zebra skin
I thought she'd stop the show, woah, woah
Singing, “Ying-yang! Ying-yang! Ah, gitch, gitchee, gitchee, ying-yang! Ying-yang!”
She did a triple somersault, and when she hit the ground
She winked at the audience, and then she turned around
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine
Saying Phoenix, Arizona, nineteen forty-nine

Yeah, but let me tell you, people
Little Egypt doesn't dance there anymore, woah, woah
She's too busy mopping and
A-taking care of shopping at the store, woah, woah
'Cause we got seven kids and

It was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly
Love the mademoiselle

It goes to show, you never can tell

A two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed
With TV dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work
The little money comin' worked out well

Boy, did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records
All rock, rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell

They bought a souped-up jitney
Was a cherry red '53
And drove it down to Orleans
To celebrate their anniversary
It was there where Pierre
Was wedded to the lovely madamoiselle

You know this boogie is for real...

I used to put my faith in worship
But then my chance to get to Heaven slipped
I used to worry about the future
But then I threw my caution to the wind
I had no reason to be carefree - no, no, no
Until I took a trip to the other side of town - yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I heard that boogie rhythm
Hey! I had no choice but to get down, down, down, down

Dance!
Nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through, just dance
Got canned heat in my heels, tonight, baby

I feel the thunder, see the lightning
I know this anger's Heaven-sent
So I've got to hang out all my hang-ups
'Cause on the boogie, I feel so Hell-bent, hey, hey
It's just an instant gut reaction, that I get
I know I've never, ever felt like this before
I don't know what to do
But, man, that's nothing new
Stuck between Hell and high water
I need a cure to make it through, hey!

Dance, yeah

Off these bad times I'm going through, just dance, hey
Got canned heat in my heels, tonight, baby
You know, know, know I'm gonna dance, yeah
Off the nasty things that people say, dance, yeah
But I'm gonna make it anyway
(Dance) Yeah, got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
You know I got canned heat in my heels

You know this boogie is for real

Only the wind can know the answers
And she cries to me when I'm asleep
She says ""you know that you can go much faster""
I know that people's talk can be so cheap, hey hey
I've got this voodoo child enveined on me
I'm gonna use my power to ascend
You know I've got these running heels to use
So, child, there's no way I'll lose
I was born to run and built to last
You'll never see my feet 'cause they move so fast

Nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through, just dance, hey

A game where there can be two winners
Unlike any sport
It depends on the prize
And knowing where the real thing lies
To make a long story short

There's guys that offer you diamonds and pearls
Those are the ones without the need
Other guys say that they can give you the world
But a world of love is what you'll get from me
Girl, those material things
Meant more to me before the day I found you
Now I truly believe
All the money in the world
Can't comfort you the way I wrap my arms around you
And I'll always be there

Ay candela, candela, candela, me quemo aé
Ay candela, candela, candela, me quemo aé

Puso un baile una jutía, para una gran diversión
De timbalero un ratón, que alegraba el campo un día
Un gato también venía, elegante y placentero
'Buenas noches, compañero' siempre dijo así el timbal
'Para alguien aquí poder tocar para descansar un poco'
Salió el ratón medio loco, 'también voy a descansar'
Y el gato en su buen bailar, bailaba un danzón liviano
El ratón se subió al guano y dice bien placentero:

¡Y ahora si quieren bailar, busquen otro timbalero!

Ay candela, candela, candela, me quemo aé

If I were to say to you:
""Can you keep a secret?""
Would you know just what to do
Or where to keep it?
Then I say, ""I love you""
Foul the situation
Hey, girl, I thought we were the right combination

Who broke my heart?
You did, you did
Bow to the target
Blame Cupid, Cupid
You think you're smart?
Stupid, stupid

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow
Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow

No rhythm in cymbals, no tempo in drums
Love on arrival, she comes when she comes
Right on the target but wide of the mark
What I thought was fire was only the spark
The sweetest melody is an unheard refrain
So lower your sights
Yeah, but raise your aim, raise your aim

Who broke my heart?
You did, you did
Bow to the target
Blame Cupid, Cupid
You think you're smart?
Stupid, stupid

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow
Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow

I thought you loved me
But it seems you don't care
I care enough to know
I can never love you

Who broke my heart?
You did, you did
Bow to the target
Blame Cupid
You think you're smart?
That's stupid
Right from the start
When you know we would part

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow
Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow

Heart, shoot that poison arrow
Shoot that poison arrow"

Nobody move, there's blood on the floor

Where did it go? Did I leave it in the cold?

Deep in the cut, drowning it in pain
Somebody help 'cause I can't find my way

When I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real (Ain't real)
Why in the world would I give my heart to you
Just to watch you throw it in the trash?
I've been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on
Where were you when I needed you the most?
Now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest

I took my troubles down to Madame Ruth
You know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth
We lost you on Madame Ruth, you got too soft bill. Keep singin' out. And every, helm, helm, you don't get any softer on any of those other cuts. This is it, this is the tempo and that's the grove, okay? Take sixteen

I took my troubles down to Madame Ruth
You know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth
She's got a pad on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
Sellin' little bottles of Love Potion No. 9

I told her that I was a flop with chicks
I've been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
She said, ""What you need is Love Potion No. 9""

She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink
She said, ""I'm gonna mix it up right here in the sink""
It smelled like turpentine and looked like India ink
I held my nose, I closed my eyes (I took a drink)

I didn't know it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight
But when I kissed a cop at Thirty-Fourth and Vine
He broke my little bottle of Love Potion No. 9


I held my nose, I closed my eyes (I took a drink)

I didn't know it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight
I had so much fun that I'm goin' back again
I wonder what'll happen with Love Potion No. 10

Dig!

The chills that you spill up my back keep me filled
With satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another (You know that's right)
Your groove I do deeply dig
No walls, only the bridge
My supper dish, my succotash wish (Sing it, baby)

The depth of hula groove
Moves us to the nth hoop
We're gonna groove to Horton Hears a Who-who
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another
DJ Soul was on a roll
I've been told he can't be sold
He's not vicious or malicious
Just de-lovely and delicious
I couldn't ask for another

Some looks in this torso (Uh, yeah)
Hot, got a deal, you wanna know (wanna know)
Delightful, truly delightful (lightful)
Makin' it, doin' it, 'specially at a show (show)
Feelin' kinda high like a Hendrix haze (haze)

All inside of me, heart especially (side, yeah)
Hilt of the rhythm, where I wanna be (c'mon)
Flowin', glowin' with electric eyes (eyes)
You dip to the dive, baby yo, realize (yeah)
Baby, you see the funky side of me
Baby, you'll see that rhythm is the key (yeah)
Get, get, wit' it, wit' it, can't think, quit it, quit it
Stomp on the stoop when I hear a funk loop (bloop)
Playin' Pied Piper, follow what's true
Baby, just sing about the groove!

Le ho sparato un bacio in bocca, uno di quelli che schiocca
Sulla pista indiavolata, lì per lì l'ho strapazzata
L'ho lanciata, riafferrata, senza fiato l'ho lasciata
Tre le braccia mi è cascata, era cotta e innamorata
Per i fianchi l'ho bloccata e ne ho fatto marmellata

M'è venuta una pensata, nella tana I'ho portata
Le ho versato un'aranciata, lei s'e fatta una risata
Al mio whisky si è aggrappata e cinque litri s'è scolata
Mi sembrava bella e andata, m'ha baciato, I'ho baciata
Ad un tratto I'ho agganciata, dalle braccia m'e sgusciata
M'ha guardato, I'ho guardata, l'ho bloccata, accarezzata
Sul visino suo di fata, ma sembrava una patata
L'ho acchiappata, I'ho frullata e ne ho fatto una frittata

You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will but what a thrill
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

I laughed at love 'cause I thought it was funny
You came along and you moved me, honey
I've changed my mind, this love is fine
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

You kiss me, baby
Woah, it feels good
Hold me, baby
Girl, love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
But I'ma tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I get nervous, but it sure is fun
Come on, baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire


Well, kiss me, baby
Woah, it feels good
Hold me, baby
I wanna love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
I gotta tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous, 'cause it sure is fun
Come on, baby, you're driving me crazy

Эмалированное судно
Окошко, тумбочка, кровать
Жить тяжело и неуютно
Зато уютно умирать
Эмалированное судно
Окошко, тумбочка, кровать
Жить тяжело и неуютно
Зато уютно умирать


И тихо капает из крана
И жизнь растрёпана, как блядь
Выходит, как бы, из тумана
И видит: тумбочка, кровать
И я пытаюсь приподняться
Хочу в глаза ей поглядеть
Взглянуть в глаза и разрыдаться
И никогда не умереть, никогда не умереть
Никогда не умереть, никогда не умереть
Никогда не умереть, никогда не умереть

I got your number, and I called you on the phone
Your sister lied and said that you were not at home
Burning desire with every letdown
And I'm trying not to go crazy

What am I to do, I can't get close to you

A-hey, do it now, huh
Yeah, hey

Hey-ah, once I was a boogie singer
Playing in a rock and roll band
I never had no problems, yeah
Burning down the one-night stands
Then everything around me, yeah
It got to start to feeling so low
And I decided quickly, yes, I did, heh
To disco down and check out the show

Yeah, they were dancing and singing
And moving to the grooving
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

""Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die"", heh heh
'Til you die, yeah (What?)
Hear, hear, heh

A-heh, I tried to understand this (Yeah)
Heh, I thought that they were out of their minds
Heh, how could I be so foolish, how could I
To not see I was the one behind?
So still I kept on fighting
Well, losing every step of the way (Hey, what'd you do?)
I said, ""I must go back there"", I got to go back
And check to see if things still the same

Yeah, they were dancing and singing
And moving to the grooving
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

""Play that funky music, white boy (Yeah)
Play that funky music right, oh
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die"", heh
'Til you die (Yeah)
Woah, 'til you die
Gonna play some electrified funky music, yow!

Ah ha ha

Hey, wait a minute, now first it wasn't easy
Changing rock and roll and minds
Yeah, things were getting shaky
(Yeah) I thought I'd have to leave it behind, uh
Ooh, but now it's so much better, it's so much better
I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feeling, no, I won't
Of how I learned my lesson that day

When they were dancing and singing
And moving to the grooving
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

""Play that funky music, white boy

They say the day is ending
Let's watch the Sun go down
And plan a holiday for two
For all eternity
We'll ride a cloud so you can see
The world I created just for you

Oh, I saw you standing on the street
I wanted to meet, just stop a while
You give me a smile to say hello
You made me feel so good inside
That I realized that I couldn't hide
The feeling that came when you failed to say

I believe in miracles

Don't you, don't you?

I believe in miracles, baby
I believe in you

I believe in you

I don't know what people are saying
Or what games that they are playing
Or if they're playing that same old game on me
People never knowing where they're going or what they're showing
So, come on boys, show a little love for me

I believe in miracles

Don't you, don't you?

I believe in miracles

Don't you, don't you?

Here we are together, face to face
Forever in a place that I created
Just for you, you, you
So, people are better than what you give
Believe in dreams and think they're real
And, one day soon, your miracles will come true

My head was in a bad place and I'm wondering what it's good for

I been running trying to get hung up in my mind (oooh)
Got to give myself a good talking-to this time
Just need a little brain salad surgery (oooh)
Got to cure this insecurity
I been in the wrong place, but it must have been the right time
I been in the right place, but it must have been the wrong song
I been in the right vein, but it seems like the wrong arm
I been in the right world, but it seems wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong

Slipping, dodging, sneaking, creeping, hiding out down the street (oooh)
See me life shaking with every ho' I meet
Refried confusion is making itself clear (oooh)
Wonder which way do I go to get on out of here

I been in the right place, but it must have been the wrong time
I'd have said the right thing, but I must have used the wrong line
I'd have took the right road, but I must have took a wrong turn
Would've made the right move, but I made it at the wrong time

You park the car out in the open you can walk inside
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her ma'am
Because every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed

Oh, Carol, don't let him steal your heart away

Now, if you want to hear some music like the boys are playing
Hold tight, bang your foot, don't let it carry you away
Don't let the heat overcome you when they play so loud
Will the music intrigue you when they get a crowd
Well you cannot dance I know you would you could
I got my eyes on you, baby, 'cause you dance so good

Your touch has thrilled me
Like the rush of the wind
And your arms have held me
Safe from a rolling sea
There's always been a quiet place
To harbor you and me
Our love is like a ship on the ocean
We've been sailing with a cargo
Full of love and devotion

So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion
To rock the boat
Don't rock the boat, baby

Rock the boat
Don't tip the boat over

Don't rock the boat, baby

Up to now
We sailed through every storm
And I've always had your tender lips
To keep me warm
Oh, I need to have the strength
That flows from you
Don't let me drift away my dear
When love can see me through
Our love is like a ship on the ocean
We've been sailing with a cargo
Full of love and devotion

What's the sense in sharing this one and only life
Ending up just another lost and lonely wife?
You count up the years
And they will be filled with tears
Love only breaks up to start over again
You'll get the babies
But you won't have your man
While he is busy loving every woman that he can, uh-huh

Say I'm gonna leave
A hundred times a day
It's easier said than done
When you just can't break away
(Just can't break away)

Oh! Young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me
My man and me
Oh! Young hearts
To yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you

It's high time now, just one crack at life
Who wants to live in trouble and strife
My mind must be free to learn all I can about me, mmm
I'm gonna love me for the rest of my days
Encourage the babies every time they say
Self-preservation is what's really going on today

Say I'm gonna turn loose
A thousand times a day
How can I turn loose
When I just can't break away
(When I just can't break away)

Oh! Young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me
You and me
Oh! Young hearts
To yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you

They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me

Oh! Young hearts
To yourself be true

I think it's going around

She turned the speaker down
And then she turned on the radio
I watched a silent movie digging funky sound

Uh huh, she's got the boogie fever
I think it's going around
I took my baby to the pizza parlor (Pizza parlor)

Tell me, what can it be?
Is it some new disease?
They call it boogie fever
You got to boogie down

Girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
A part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you
Here in your arms, I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now, I think I would die

Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time (Minute at a time)

There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
(Let history repeat itself)
Reflecting how I feel for you
I'm thinking 'bout those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love, I know I would die

Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine

(Emme - a - erre - ka', M - A - R - K)

Apro il telefono, ci sono due vie
Due file di barre scritte non avendo nient'altro
Vivo in freestyle e mi dico: ""Carpe diem""
Se posso spaccare il palco chiedo: ""Perché non farlo?""
Binario 55 'n chill with my guys
E non voglio più avere i tuoi problemi (No, no)
Binario 55 'n chill with my guys
Nella mia testa ho fuso i due emisferi

Mi alzo dal letto e fermo la sveglia che suona (click!)
Mentre scazzo in dialetto lo schermo segna che è ora
Sforno in cassa il biglietto per il ritorno da Roma
Frеmo e aspetto quel trеno che passa una volta sola
E becco Gab in stazione, non il plug, rimastone
Ieri al club, fighe storie, scleri e rap, mica cover
Dice ""Fre', nel mercato c'è un'intossicazione (Eh sì eh)
Vige il cash sperperato, e noi siam mossi dal cuore""
E allora scrivo e fillo in giro sul Flixbus
Certi eventi e sentimenti per far rendita
Hai zero identità, qui perdi i denti, fra'
E se incido al micro uccido ma ho l'indennità (Pow, pow!)
Qui hai la crème de la crème della Puglia
Ogni traccia che ho è più hot della 'nduja (Hot)
Usare ogni beat come ring dalla culla
Poi mi ha reso Mark, peso Max, Alleluia (Alleluia)
Se capisci il divario, allora, com'è che spacchi?
Il mio flow è magia, va via, strofe mad-maxi
Sparisci come sul binario 9¾
Aria sana in cypha a fare in 9 i 3/4
E quindi dai (dai)
Non ti smentisci mai
Babbo, spingi hype e manco stringi il mic
Scarso, fingi ai live, passo da Fifty a Styles
E aspetto avaro l'orario al Binario 55

Apro il telefono, ci sono due vie
Due file di barre scritte non avendo nient'altro
Vivo in freestyle e mi dico: ""Carpe diem""
Se posso spaccare il palco chiedo: ""Perché non farlo?""
Binario 55 'n chill with my guys
E non voglio più avere i tuoi problemi
Binario 55 'n chill with my guys
Nella mia testa ho fuso i due emisferi

Sei un pisciazzo, no' uno spara spara (Pam)
Il rione mi dà sempre più di una favela, seh
Un bimbo è in strada se la strada paga
Mi proteggo dai demoni, Cruz de Caravaca
Io non disso chi è sconfitto, vado dritto in vetta
Zitto merda, in zona è un labirinto e non ci ho visto scelta
Non mi lamento, ma capisco cosa mi sconcerta
E dal fondo dell'abisso comunque vi piscio in testa
Me ne fotto dei critici
Sai che sfondo i tuoi limiti
Tu fai il mostro ma levati, faccio il fosso a 'sti scemi
Io ti mozzo se m'imiti
Levo intorno i tuoi simili
In un pozzo di ebeti non dimostro gli schemi
Livello alto, io vi batto con 4 rimette (Goddamn!)
Non sei scaltro, sopra il palco ti intacco 'sti rapper (Goddamn!)
Metti in ballo ciò che valgo, non parlo per niente (Goddamn!)
Per quel che ho fatto
Non mi calcolo manco 'sta gente (Goddamn!)
Voglio una corona come copricapo
Di livello sono fuori stato, fuori status
Della media che vi ho appena rovinato
Conosco i miei traguardi
Non mi serve mica esser nominato, ah
Mischio i flussi con le percussioni (Uh-uh)
Così da non pensare alle delusioni
Smonto dei bulletti come dei bulloni
In Puglia di 'sta merda sto tra i precursori (Grr-pah)

Apro il telefono, ci sono due vie
Due file di barre scritte non avendo nient'altro
Vivo in freestyle e mi dico: ""Carpe diem""

Brush shoulders with the stars
Where strangers take you by the hand

Then kiss in Tropicana’s heat
Watch the waves break on the bay
Oh, soft white sands, a blue lagoon
Cocktail time, a summer’s tune

And the beat goes on
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong, on and on

Do you ever wonder
That to win, somebody's got to lose
I might as well get over (The blues)
Just like fishing in the ocean
There'll always be someone new

(Who'll love you better)
You did me wrong
But I've been through stormy weather

And the beat goes on
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on (You'd better believe it)
Still moving strong, on and on

Don't stop for nobody
This time, I'll keep my feet on solid ground
Now I understand myself (When I'm down)
Like the sweet sound of hip music
There'll always be something new

To keep the tables turning
Hate this simple song
But there'll never be an ending

And the beat goes on
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong, on and on

The beat goes on (The beat goes on)

The beat goes on

(Do you ever wonder) Well
That to win, somebody's got to lose
I might as well get over (The blues)

There'll always be someone new

(Who'll love you better)

But I've been through stormy weather

And the beat goes on
Don't stop the groovin'

And the beat goes on (Got to make it last)

You've got all that is really needed
To save a dying world from its funklessness

Stupidly I forced a smile
My composure was secure
I wore a silly grin from ear to ear
A smile they saw right through
Oh, but then like a streak of lightning it came
Filling my brain with this pain
Without saying a word this voice I heard
""Give up the funk, you punk""

Unfunky kind of UFO
(From the sun)
Here from the sun
(You've got the groove)
You've got the groove and we want some
(Unfunky and obsolete)
We're unfunky and we're obsolete
(And out of time)
And we're out of time
Gonna take your funk and make it mine
(""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh"")

You could feel so much better
If you would show me how to funk like you do

You've got all that is really needed
To save a dying world from its funklessness

Deep in pain I called the names
Of some funkified friends of mine
And they were on the road and gettin' it on
And groovin' for hours live
Oh, like a streak of lightning it came
Filling my brain with pain
Without saying a word, this voice I heard
""Give up the funk, you punk""

Unfunky kind of UFO

Here from the sun
(You've got the groove)
You've got the groove and we want some

If you would show me how to funk like you do

You've got all that is really needed
To save a dying world from its funklessness

I don't know where but they were near
They took me by surprise
They crept upon me early this morning
Right before my eyes and they were saying
(""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sweet old music"")

(From the sun)
Here from the sun

Ridin' along in my automobile
My baby beside me at the wheel
I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile
My curiosity runnin' wild
Cruisin' and playin' the radio
With no particular place to go

Ridin' along in my automobile
I's anxious to tell her the way I feel
So I told her softly and sincere
And she leaned and whispered in my ear
Cuddlin' more and drivin' slow
With no particular place to go


No particular place to go
So we parked way out on the kokomo
The night was young and the moon was bold
So we both decided to take a stroll
Can you imagine the way I felt?
I couldn't unfasten her safety belt

Ridin' along in my calaboose
Still tryin' to get her belt aloose
All the way home I held a grudge
For the safety belt that wouldn't budge
Cruisin' and playin' the radio
With no particular place to go"

The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there, they began to wail
The band was jumping, and the joint began to swing
You shoulda heard those locked-out jailbirds sing

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Number forty-seven said to number three
""You the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Rock, rock, rock


Sad Sack was sitting on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said, ""Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
You can't find a partner, use a wooden chair""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Shifty Henry said to Bugs, ""For Heaven's sake
No one's looking, now's our chance to make a break""
Bugsy turned to Shifty, and he said, ""Nix nix
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks.""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock

With her sweet young friends

She's so good at what she does
All she wants to do is kiss and hug
She's got me in love
And I can feel my heart

A shovel for a miner who left his home to wander
Some rheumatism pills for the settlers in the hills

You better crack it up before it's too far gone
Go by y'r instinct, get down to the real thing
She's no lie, never leads you wrong

Symphonic Nellies, pretending high class
I've seen those funky assed turkeys
On their big platform discoshoes
The new wave hype & the old jive juice
I'm a heart & soul, Rock & Roll

It's magic, fantastic, plastic fireball
Makes you strung out for life
Makes you stumble & fall
They're gonna call you names you never heard before
They got you comin' down on music you adore
But when I do my suicide for you
I hope you miss me too

I remember when I met you, baby
You were on your way to be wed
You were such a sexy thing
I loved the way you walked, the things you said
I was so nonchalant
I didn't want you to be misled
But I've got to have you, baby
I got to have you in my bed
You said:
""I'm just a virgin, and I'm
On my way to be wed
You're such a hunk
So full of spunk""

I'll give you head 'til you're burning up
Head 'til you get enough
Head 'til your love is red
Head, love you 'til you're dead

You know you're good, girl
I think you like to go down
You wouldn't have stopped
But, uh, I came on your wedding gown
You said:
""I must confess
I wanna get undressed and go to bed""
With that, I jammed, you fool
You married me instead

Now morning, noon, and night
I give you head 'til you're burning up

I'd like to dedicate this song to little Junior Parker
A cousin of mine who's gone on, but we'd like to kinda carry on in his name

I don't know why I love you like I do
After all these changes that you put me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I haven't seen hide nor hair of you yet

I wanna know, won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

Take me to the river and wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul? Put my feet on the ground

I don't know why she treated me so bad
Look at all the things that we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I will never regret

I wanna know, won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?


Hold me, love me, please me, tease me
Till I can't, till I can't, can't take no more

Take me to the river

I don't know why I love you like I do
After all the things that you put me through
The sixteen candles are burning on my wall
Turning me into the biggest fool of them all

I wanna know, can't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

Want you to dip me in the water

And I can hear my baby call my name
It's as if as though I'm standin' at her front door
I can hear that doggone plane
Now I'll be so glad to see my baby
And hold her in my arms once more
Now when I kiss her lips, I turn her back over flip
And I'll forget about those feet of mine

So I got to keep on walkin'

I got to get to my baby again

So ya wanna dump out yo' trick bag
Ease on in a hip thang
But you ain't exactly sure what is hip
So you started to let your hair grow
Spent big bucks on your wardrobe
Somehow, ya know there's much more to the trip

What is hip?
Tell me, tell me, if you think you know
What is hip?
If you're really hip
The question, ""Will it show?""
You're into a hip trip
Maybe hipper than hip
What is hip?

You became a part of a new breed
Been smokin' only the best weed
Hangin' out with the so called ""Hippie set.""
Seen in all the right places
Seen with just the right faces
You should be satisfied, but still it ain't quite right

What is hip?
Tell me, tell me, if you think you know
What is hip?
If you're really hip
The question, ""Will it show?""
You're into a hip trip
Maybe hipper than hip
What is hip?

Come on

Hipness is. What it is
Hipness is. What it is
Hipness is. What it is
Sometimes hipness is, what it ain't

You went an' found you a guru
In an effort to find you a new you
And maybe even raise your conscious level
While you're striving to find the right road
There's one thing you should know
What's hip today, might become passé

What is hip?
Tell me, tell me, if you think you know
What is hip?
If you're really hip
The question, ""Will it show?""
You're into a hip trip
Maybe hipper than hip
What is hip?

Think about it y'all
What is hip?
Tell me, tell me, if you think you know
What is hip?
If you're really hip
The question, ""Will it show?""
What is hip?
Tell me, tell me, if you think you know
What is hip?
If you're really hip
The question, ""Will it show?""

What is hip?
Ahhhhhhhhh
What is hip?
I'd like to know
What is hip?
Is it in the style of your hair?
What is hip?
Is it in the clothes that you wear?
What is hip?
I'd like to know
What is hip?
I'd like to know
What is hip?
What is hip y'all? Hey

Hey! Oh

Y'know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy
Left a good job down in the city
But there's just one thing
You see, we never, ever do nothing
Working for the man every night and day
Nice and easy
Well, I never lost one minute of sleeping
We always do it nice and rough
Worrying 'bout the way that things might've been
So we're going to take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
Big wheel, keep on turning
But then we're going to do the finish rough
Proud Mary, keep on burning
This is the way we do ""Proud Mary""
And we're rolling, ooh
Rolling, ooh
Rolling on the river
Listen to the story

Left a good job down in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
I was worrying 'bout the way that things might have been

You know that big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary, keep on burning
And we're rolling (rolling)
Rolling, yeah (rolling)
Rolling on the river (rolling on the river)

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
You know I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

You know the big wheel keep on turning

Come on over to joy ride, and let your morals be
Ain't no way to deny it, if it's in your soul
You don't know 'till you try it, baby, let the good times roll
Let me taste your life. Let me fill your stream
Let me make you feel it right now, just lay back and dream
Got this thing on the move, it's beginin'
Got a strange kind of feeling, under my skin
I hear my baby knockin', at my front door
She knows what I got, she wants some more
And when it's all over, I start to come down
Think of the restin' place, I'll leave the ground"

Whenever I'm with him, something inside (Inside)
Starts to burnin', and I'm filled with desire
Could it be a devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?

It's like a heat wave
Burnin' in my heart (It's like a heat wave)
I can't keep from cryin' (It's like a heat wave)
It's tearin' me apart

Whenever he calls my name soft, low, sweet and plain (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Right then, right then, I feel that burnin' flame (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Has high blood pressure got a hold on me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?

It's like a heat wave

I can't keep from cryin' (It's like a heat wave)
It's tearin' me apart

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, heat wave
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, heat wave

Sometimes I stare in space, tears all over my face
I can't explain it, don't understand it
I ain't never felt like this before
Now, that funny feeling has me amazed
Don't know what to do, my head's in a haze

It's like a heat wave
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (But it's all right, girl)
Oh, yeah (Go ahead, girl)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Well, it's all right, girl)
Oh (Ain't nothin' but love, girl)

We did that one with Allen Toussaint in New Orleans (Yeah)
Yeah, girl, you remember him, what a wonderful man (Yeah)
Yes, and, um, when we did this song, we didn't know what it meant (Yeah)
It meant, ""Will you sleep with me tonight?"" (Yeah)
So, we didn't know what it meant
We just knew that, ""Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?"" sounded like a hit
So we sang it, and it was that
And then the nuns called on us and said, ""Why are these ladies singing about hookers?"" (Yeah)
Well, we didn't really know (Yeah)
It just sounded good (Yeah, I know)
Okay, one of those things (Well, I took a little bit of French so I kind of)
Right, just a little bit, I know you (Just a little bit, so), right?
Well, I was a young girl, I had no clue (I know), but we found out
We were just singing, when we—
Just singing, a lot of times, we were just singing because it felt so good (It felt good)

Je chantais pour la première fois
Le public ne me connaissait pas
Oh quelle année cette année-là
Cette année-là
Le rock'n'roll venait d'ouvrir ses ailes
Et dans mon coin je chantais belle, belle, belle
Et le public aimait ça
Déjà, aaaah
Les Beatles étaient quatre garçons dans le vent
Et moi ma chanson disait marche tout droit
Cette année-là
Quelle joie d'être l'idole des jeunes
Pour des fans qui cassaient les fauteuils
Plus j'y pense et moins j'oublie
J'ai découvert mon premier mon dernier amour
Le seul le grand l'unique et pour toujours le public
Cette année-là
Dans le ciel passait une musique
Un oiseau qu'on appelait Spoutnik
Oh quelle année cette année-là

C'est là qu'on a dit adieu à Marilyn au cœur d'or
Tandis que West Side battait tous les records
Cette année-là
Les guitares tiraient sur les violons
On croyait qu'une révolution arrivait
Cette année-là
C'était hier, mais aujourd'hui rien n'a changé
C'est le même métier qui ce soir recommence encore
C'était l'année...soixante deux
C'était l'année...soixante deux

I don't know but the players name is Ohio's, I know where Ohio is
So you know he's from down there 'cause he don't even know how to say it, right Trees?

But I'm sure glad you're a soul brother, because that's a country stroke ya got there
A cornbread lick, ya got it

Brother Martin, give him another round of applause
I didn't say lay in the grass, I say your grange
Say Fred, this is our music and band director
Sure got a strange horn there brother
I like it. Black horn
(Black and proud)
Right on, right on
But say one thing brother, do you got a name for it, 'cause I know B.B. King named for his guitar, ""Lucille."" What'd you name your horn?
(I call it the soul sister)
The only thing I gotta disagree with, is it look different with no hot pants, baby
Lookie here, because I want everyone to feel funky
You're gonna get ""Sex Machine,"" and if that don't do ya, we'll give you some more sex
And if that don't do it then, we'll see ya later"

Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell
Go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by, they would stop and say
""Oh, my, but that little country boy could play""
Go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Johnny B. Goode


His mother told him, ""Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Sayin' 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'""

Go, go
Go, Johnny, go
Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, Johnny B. Goode"

I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else, but not for me

Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried

I thought love was more or less a givin' thing
Seems the more I gave, the less I got
What's the use in tryin'?
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine, I got rain

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer

I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried

You were so quiet there by yourself
Things were fine 'til they took you down
And opened you up and passed you around
John was the first one to pull you down
He took one drink and he started to clown
Passed you to Hazel, Jane, and Jack
Penelope got you and passed you right back
The doorbell rang and what did you see?
In walked Henry, Fred, and Marie
They hit you high, they hit you low
They hit you fast and they hit you slow
Whiskey on the shelf
You were so quiet there by yourself
Things were fine 'til they took you down
Opened you up and passed you around

Killed you dead and wanted another
They reached on the shelf and grabbed your brother
It's a shame the way they did you in
Then reached up and got your brother Gin

Grandfather Wine began to tremble with fright
Wondered if the party was going to last all night
Grandfather Wine knew without a doubt
He was next in line if the juice ran out
Whiskey on the shelf
You were so quiet there by yourself
Things were fine 'til they took you down
Opened you up and passed you around

Now look at everybody, they've got real tight
Now they want to start a fight
John never did nothin' wrong in his life
Now he's in a corner with the policeman's wife
Frank's so drunk he can hardly see
Trying to make love to Penelope
She took a bottle and hit him in the jaw
That's when the neighbors called the law

When he ask you do you love him, smile and kiss his cheek
Walk away and twist your hip, make sure you keep him weak
Don't let nobody take care o' your business better than you do
Do what he wants, give him what he wants, respect will come to you

And than you can hold your man, you can hold your man, you can hold your man
You can hold... hey!

Never get so confident with nothin' you want to know
Cause that's the time, you lose your thing, then you got to go
You know what we got to tell 'em to be the untold boss
Use your thing so carefully and don't be a total loss
Sister, when you loved your man, be careful how you tell 'im that
He will put you back on the corner, use you like a Sunday hat

Looking for the love getaway
Headed for the love getaway
I got me a car that's as big as a whale
And we're heading on down to the Love Shack
I got me a Chrysler that seats about 20
So hurry up and bring your jukebox money

'Cause love rules at the Love Shack”
Well, it's set way back in the middle of a field
Just a funky old shack and I gotta get back
Glitter on the mattress
Glitter on the highway
Glitter on the front porch
Glitter on the highway

And around and around and around

My baby's always dancin' and it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no lovin' and that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco at every kinda disco
From that night, I kissed our love goodbye

Don't blame it on the sunshine

Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times

That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow, it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely, I've seen the lightning leave me
And my baby just can't take her eyes off me

This magic music grooves me, that dirty rhythm fools me
The devil's gotten to me through this dance
I'm full of funky fever, a fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a super trance

Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Number forty-seven said to number three
""You the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Rock, rock, rock


Sad Sack was sitting on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said, ""Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
You can't find a partner, use a wooden chair""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Shifty Henry said to Bugs, ""For Heaven's sake
No one's looking, now's our chance to make a break""
Bugsy turned to Shifty, and he said, ""Nix nix
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks.""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock"

You can't touch this
You can't touch this

My, my, my, my music hits me so hard
Makes me say ""Oh my Lord""
Thank you for blessin' me with a mind to rhyme and two hype feet
It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

I told you, homeboy (You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we livin' and ya know (You can't touch this)
Look in my eyes, man (You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics (You can't touch this)

Fresh new kicks and pants
You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin', hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission, so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch

Yo, I told you (You can't touch this)
Why you standin' there, man? (You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school's in, sucker (You can't touch this)

Give me a song or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' 'bout the Hammer, you're talkin' 'bout a show
That's hyped and tight
Singers are sweatin', so pass them a wipe
Or a tape to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

That's word because you know (You can't touch this)
You can't touch this
Break it down!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh—
Stop, Hammer time!

Go with the flow, it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave yo' hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump
(Bump, bump, bump)

Yeah (You can't touch this)
Look, man (You can't touch this)
You better get hype, boy, because you know you can't (You can't touch this)
Ring the bell, school's back in
Break it down!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Every time you see me, the Hammer's just so hyped
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doin' this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
""It's Hammer!"" ""Go Hammer!"" ""MC Hammer!"" ""Yo Hammer!""
And the rest can go and play
You can't touch this

I was asked in New York City: Do you like my clothes?
I'm talking to my tape recorder, walking down the road
But on Friday night, I'm, purified that my feet don't touch the floor
When the rubber meets the road, in between my toes

Everyday is fucking perfect, it's a paradise
Watch my life like it's a movie, have to watch it twice
A boy looks at a girl, and a girl looks like a pony
She gallops all day long, in between my toes
And every night, she's purified, she don't do that dance no more
When the rubber meets the road, in between my toes

I'm skankin on the dance floor, I'm drunk off that hennessey
I ain't sober, I don't mix with Coca-Cola or soda
But right now I'm on a roller, I take a look over my shoulder
When I see that sexy thing, I think it's time to work my way over
So I shuffle on my heals, and bounce on my toes
I'm crazy, and she knows, still it's all good I suppose
She picked a good place and she packed it up
I got behind her and I lapped it up
And we danced all night til the sun came up
Then I took her to my yard then I racked it up

I'm a member of the ju ju nation
Down in New Orleans
You don't need an application
If you move your feet

Explode if you poke it
Exposed on the floor
It grows if you soak it
It rolls out the door
Now

Summer time, every night, now my feet don't touch the floor
She don't do that dance no more, in between my toes
Him and you, you and I, I don't do that dance no more
When the rubber meets the road, in between my toes

The lady starts to sing, but she ain't no disco dancer
She learned to shake her thing, in between my toes

Explode if you poke it
Exposed on the floor
It grows if you soak it
It rolls out the door

Explode if you poke it
Exposed on the floor
It grows if you soak it
It rolls out the door"

Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mambo Number 5

One, two, three, four, five
Everybody in the car, so come on, let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna beer-bust, like I had last week
I must stay deep, 'cause talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue, you know they gettin' sweeter
So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me, flirtin' is just like a sport
Anything fly, it's all good, let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ha)

Mambo Number 5 (Ha)

Jump up and down and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound, put your hands on the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this, then you're doin' it right

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ha)

Fall in love with a girl like you

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Don't procrastinate, don't articulate
Girl, it's getting late, getting upset waiting around

Yes, a little less conversation, a little more action, please
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me
A little more bite, a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and, baby, satisfy me
Satisfy me"

Under my thumb
The girl who once had me down
Under my thumb
The girl who once pushed me around

It's down to me
The difference in the clothes she wears
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
Ain't it the truth, babe?

Under my thumb
Is a squirming dog who's just had her day
Under my thumb
A girl who has just changed her ways

It's down to me, yes it is
The way she does just what she's told
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
Ah, ah, say it's alright

Under my thumb
Is a Siamese cat of a girl
Under my thumb
She's the sweetest pet in the world

It's down to me
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Ah, take it easy babe
Yeah

It's down to me, oh yeah
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
Yeah, it feels alright

Under my thumb
Her eyes are just kept to herself
Under my thumb
Well I, I can still look at someone else

It's down to me, oh that's what I said
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Say, it's alright
Say it's all...
Say it's all...
Take it easy babe
Take it easy babe
It feels alright
Take it, take it easy, babe"

A sense of expectation hanging in the air
Giving out a spark
Across the room, your eyes are glowing in the dark

And here we go again
We know the start, we know the end

And now we're back to get some more

""The girl means business, so I'll offer her a drink""
Looking mighty proud
I see you leave your table, pushing through the crowd

I'm really glad you came

You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day

Come on, baby, let's not fight

A man walks down the street, he says, ""Why am I soft in the middle now?
Why am I soft in the middle? The rest of my life is so hard
I need a photo-opportunity, I want a shot at redemption
Don't wanna end up a cartoon in a cartoon graveyard""

Bone digger, bone digger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away in my well-lit door
Mr. Beer Belly, Beer Belly
Get these mutts away from me, you know
I don't find this stuff amusing anymore

Uh, if you would be my bodyguard, I can be your long-lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al

A man walks down the street, he says, ""Why am I short of attention?
Got a short little span of attention and, woah, my nights are so long
Where's my wife and family? What if I die here?
Who'll be my role model now that my role model is gone, gone?""

He ducked back down the alley with some, uh
Roly-poly little bat-faced girl
All along, along, there were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations

Uh, if you would be my bodyguard, I can be your long-lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al
You can call me Al


A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the third world
Maybe it's his first time around
Doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound, the sound (Ooh, ooh)

Of cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity, he says, ""Amen,"" and, ""Hallelujah""

If you'd be my bodyguard, I can be your long-lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al
You can call me

Na, na, na-na, na, na, na-na
Na, na, na-na, na, na, na-na, na-na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can call you Betty

Them wild-eyed boys that'd been away
Haven't changed, hadn't much to say
But man, I still think them cats are crazy
They were askin' if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were livin' downtown
Drivin' all the old men crazy

You know that chick that used to dance a lot?
Every night, she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she's got
Man, when I tell ya she was cool, she was red hot
I mean she was steamin'
And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't wanna know, forget her

Guess who's back in town
You spread the word around

Friday night, they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's bar and grill
The drink will flow and blood will spill
And if the boys wanna fight, you better let 'em
That jukebox in the corner blastin' out my favourite song
The nights are gettin' warmer, it won't be long
Won't be long till summer comes
Now that the boys are here again

Struttin' my way on over to you
Seems like these days I got nothing to do
Hit the sidewalk and strut with you
Struttin' in the morning, struttin' at noon
Struttin' in the nighttime under the moon
Hey you, I like you too
And do you mind if I strut for you?
Baby, feel free to strut for me
You got a strut everybody should see
Watch that thing go side to side
Strut so hard with your struttin' thighs
Strut your way into my mind, I'm a fool
'Cause you're struttin' so fine
How about a little strut, it don't cost a dollar
Take my dog, don't forget the collar
But I'm the dog and I like your smell, can't help
That you strut so well
And baby, you got a head start
Struttin' your way into my heart
Take your hat off, make yourself at home
How about stay the night, and strut on home

Day two, I'm in love with your strut

A question for you: Wanna strut with me?
Think I make you smile as far as I can see
You make me laugh, think that I love you
How 'bout dinner 8:30 and a strut for two?
The way you strut like no one else
You got a thing all by yourself
If people can't hang, you can give them hell
You strut, clap clap, like you're ringing a bell
Don't need to go fast when you're struttin' with me
I got all night, got nowhere to be
I'm pretty fine just walkin' with you
Hold your hand while you whistle that tune
Tell you what, if you like my strut
I'll walk on ahead and you can look at my butt
Objectify, but don't cross the line
But you can be bad when it's struttin' time
'Cause you strut that thing just like a cock
Show them kids up and down the block
Flash your feathers and walk on by
You strut so good, you make Jimmy cry
Can't believe that you're struttin' with me
Let's strut somewhere everybody can see
And next to you, filled up with pride
We go boom, boom, side to side

Crack that whip, give the past a slip
Step on a crack, break your momma's back

When a problem comes along, you must whip it
Before the cream sets out too long, you must whip it
When something's going wrong, you must whip it

Now whip it into shape, shape it up, get straight
Go forward, move ahead, try to detect it, it's not too late
To whip it, whip it good

When a good time turns around, you must whip it
You will never live it down unless you whip it
No one gets away until they whip it

I say whip it, whip it good
I say whip it, whip it good

Crack that whip, give the past a slip

Pardon me, I want to talk to you
I may be kind of shy
But I just got to tell you
What I'm going through
Someone over there says
He wants to get to know you
I don't care 'cause
I really want to hold you
And I'm so scared
Girl, he might do something
To you that you like
Now I've been waiting
Such a bloody long time
Just to get this close to you
Now that you're near me
I want you to hear me
I'll tell you what I want to do

Oh, I want to do it
Do it all night
I want to do it
Do it to you right

Giving up so easy
Is something that I never do
But I'm so easy, so easy
When it comes to loving you
Can't you understand that I want
To hug and kiss you?
I'll do anything I can just
To give you happiness
And I drown, baby, drown, baby
In your arms, come on, baby
Can't you get to this?
I've been waiting such a bloody long time
And you're talking to someone else
Now that I've got your attention
There's something I want to mention

Oh, I want to do it

Don't think me unkind
Words are hard to find

From the banks of chaos in my mind

And when their eloquence escapes me
Their logic ties me up and rapes me

Have words to thank for their positions
Words that scream for your submission
And no one's jamming their transmission

Their logic ties you up and rapes you

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain’t no sound but the sound of his feet

Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?

And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah

How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you’re gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Show me how to do like you
If you say please
Please

Since age one Keita knew he had the answer
And it was that someday he'd be a dancer
And with help from his sis
Surely that boy would not miss
From being the baddest dancer in the whole neighborhood
Late at night when he was supposed to be sleeping
You could hear the pitter patter of feet creeping
To where music would play
To his sister he would say
Before his father said, ""Hey boy, get right back in that bed""

Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it, oh oh
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you, hey

Once at school they put on a talent contest
To find out who could really boogie the best
But his mama said, no
""Keita's much too young to go""
But his sister said, ""Please let him go so the world can see""
When they saw him they said, ""He must be crazy
Look at him, he ain't nothing but a baby""
But soon as he began
You knew the contest he would win
Because everyone in the audience began to cheer

Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it, oh oh oh oh

And 20 bottle of kola wine
All the people them dress up inna white

Uptown got its hustlers
The Bowery got its bums
42nd Street got Big Jim Walker
He a pool-shootin' son of a gun
Yeah, he big and dumb as a man can come
But he stronger than a country hoss
And when the bad folks all get together at night
You know they all call Big Jim ""Boss"", just because
And they say

""You don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger
And you don't mess around with Jim""

Well outta south Alabama come a country boy
He said, ""I'm lookin' for a man named Jim
I am a pool-shootin' boy, my name's Willie McCoy
But down at home they call me Slim
Yeah I'm lookin' for the king of 42nd Street
He drivin' a drop top Cadillac
Last week he took all my money, and it may sound funny
But I come to get my money back""
And everybody say, ""Jack don't you

You don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger
And you don't mess around with Jim""
Well, a hush fell over the pool room
Jimmy come boppin' in off the street
And when the cuttin' was done
The only part that wasn't bloody
Was the soles of the big man's feet, ooh
And he was cut in about a hundred places
And he was shot in a couple more
And you better believe
They sung a different kind of story
When Big Jim hit the floor, ooh now they say

""You don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger
And you don't mess around with Slim""

Yeah, Big Jim got his hat
Find out where it's at
And it's not hustlin' people strange to you
Even if you do got a two-piece custom-made pool cue

Yeah you don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger
And you don't mess around with Slim"

Well, now, it takes more than a robin to make the winter go
And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow
Well, it takes two hearts a-cookin' to make a fire grow
And baby, you've got what it takes (Yeah)

You know it takes a lot of kissin' (Tell me about it)
To make a romance sweet (Uh-huh)
Ooh, it takes a lot of lovin' to make my life complete
Mmm, and it takes a lot of woman to knock me off my feet
And baby, you've got what it takes

I said, mmm, mmm, mmm
Uh-huh, mmm
You know you've got just what it takes

Because it takes more than an effort to stay away from you
It'd take more than a lifetime to prove that I'll be true
But it takes somebody special to make me say, ""I do."" (Oh yeah)
And baby, you've got what it takes

Uh-huh, mmm, mmm, mmm

Because it takes, yeah, oh yeah
You're in my spot again, honey (I like your spot)
To stay away from you (I can't stay away from you)
It takes more than a lifetime, daddy, to prove that I'll be true
Now it's you
But it takes somebody special (Like me, baby)
To make me say, ""I do.""

Do you believe in magic, in a young girl's heart?
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic, if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like tryin' tell a stranger 'bout-a rock 'n' roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tappin', and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind


If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until mornin', 'til there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancin', baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

Yeah, do you believe in magic? yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock 'n' roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Oh, talkin' 'bout the magic

(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe, believer?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?

Oh, I wanna die

But when I see you out and about it's such a crime
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual

It happens every day, no matter what you say
You find it happens all the time
Love will never do, what you want it to
Why can't this crazy love be mine?

To hold me tight

But I was never gonna be the same

And I felt a rush
Like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around
And takin' my body under

And my, as I recall

Spinning my head around

Gun it coming off of the line, Sharona

Come a little closer, huh, ah, will ya, huh?
Close enough to look in my eyes, Sharona
Keeping it a mystery gets to me
Running down the length of my thighs, Sharona

There you were freaking out
Trying to get your head around
The fact that me and you and love is dead
See how I'm tripping out
'Cause you can't decide what you really want from me

Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
'Cause you make me love you, love you, baby
With a little L

There you were shouting out
Cranking up your altercations, getting upset in your desperation
Screamin' and hollerin'
How could this love become so paper-thin?
You're playing so hard to get
You're making me sweat just to hold your attention
I can't give you nothing more
If you ain't giving nothing to me
Don't you know that

You make me love you, love you baby
With a little L
Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
Seems like you're stepping on the pieces
Of my broken shell
'Cause you make me love, love you
With a little L, you know
That's the way you make me love you, yeah

Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
Cause you make me love you, love you, baby

Under the sign of Scorpio
Don't waste my time, your foolish' chatter
All I'm tryna do, y'all, is just try to matter

And you may not like my style

So fly with me a while

There's somethin' funky goin' on
Somethin' funky goin' on
Somethin' like—

I was raised in a cotton patch way outback
Mama used to tote me on her back
People used to brag on my brothers and sis
Look at me and shake her head, say ""How'd you get like this?""

Not dawn on myself
Ain't gonna worry about it
I just love my watermelon
Lord, I can't livе without

Somethin' funky is goin' on

Listen, mmm

Six long days
And I'm highly embarrassed
Every time I get my pay
And they working everybody
Lord, they working poor folks to death
And when you pay your rent and your car note
You ain't got a damn thing left

I program computers
I know accounting and psychology
I took a course in business
And I can speak a little Japanese, funk san

To get one week off with pay
And when I'm on my job
I better watch every word I say

Won't somebody please help me to see land, Lord
I want to play the guitar, come here guitar


Oh, somebody doing something slick
Now listen to this

Stopped at the supermarket
To get myself something to eat
And when I look at the prices
They knock me off of my feet
I was in the bologna section
And I had to take myself a close look
Now  couldn't have made these prices
With a sky hook

You know they are a liar

There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes, a flaming glow
Most people look at him with terror and with fеar
But to Moscow chicks, he was such a lovely dear
Hе could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar
But the kazachok, he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state, he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen, he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger for power
Became known to more and more people
The demands to do something about this outrageous man
Became louder and louder

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

""This man's just got to go,"" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged, ""Don't you try to do it, please""
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute, they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
""Come to visit us,"" they kept demanding
And he really came

Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and he said, ""I feel fine""
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him 'til he was dead

Oh, those Russians"

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game

Stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Tsar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
Oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Aww yeah

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, ""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When, after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
Oh yeah
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Aww yeah
(Uh, get down heavy!)

Pleased to meet you, hope you'll guess my name
Aww yeah
But what's confusin' you is just the nature of my game
Mmm yeah

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste
Mmm, yeah

Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name
Mmm, yeah
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Mmm, mean it, get down

I begged her and I pleaded like a natural man

And then, whoops oh Lord, I was the father of twins

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had, mm-mmm, kisses sweeter than wine

And they all had a sweetheart a-knockin' at the door
They all got married and they wouldn't hesitate

Yeah, here comes Amos

Now Amos Moses was a Cajun
He lived by his self in the swamp
He hunted alligator for livin'
He just knock 'em in the head with a stump
The Louisiana law gonna get you Amos!
It ain't legal huntin' alligator down in the swamp boy!

Now everybody blamed his old man
For makin' him mean as a snake
When Amos Moses was a boy
His Daddy would use him for alligator bait
Tie a rope around his waist and throw him in the swamp
Alligator bait in the Louisiana Bayou

About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a man called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well, they raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groceries
They named him after a man of the cloth, called him Amos Moses

Now all the folks around south Louisiana
Said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest, the meanest alligator
And just use one hand
That's all he got left cuz alligator bit it!
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow!

Well the Sheriff got wind that Amos
Was in the swamp tracking alligator skin
So he snuck in the swamp, gonna get the boy
But he never come out again
Well I wonder where the Louisiana Sheriff went to?
Well you can sure get lost in the Louisiana Bayou!

About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a cat called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well, they raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groceries
They named him after a man of the cloth, called him Amos Moses

Set out on 'em Amos
Make it count, Son!
About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a man called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hanna..."

My heart gives a chil
I feel such a thrill
My feet won't keep still
When they swing that music
Rythm like that puts me in a trance
Oh you can't blame me for wanting to dance
From what I understand
It must be just grand
To play in a band
When they swing that music
Oh I'm as happy as can be
When they swing that music for me
With my eyes I can see
All of the glee
The bees in the knees
When they swing that music
Rythm like that don't do nothing but make me smile
Oh you can't blame me if I'm gone for a while
From what has been said
I'm getting ahead
I'll swing you to bed
Once they've swung that music
Oh I'm as happy as can be
When you swing that music with me

My head feels a buzz
A reason there was
I feel buzz because
They're swinging that music
Rythm like that sends me up the wall
Oh you can't blame me if I don't wanna fall
From what I have heard
It must mean the world
To dance with that girl
When they swing that music
Oh I'm happy as can be
When you swing that music with me"

Crazy, but that's how it goes
Millions of people living as foes

Life's a bitter shame

I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools
I've watched all the dropouts, who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role

Mental wounds still screaming
Driving me insane

I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words, yeah, yeah

Heirs of a cold war, that's what we've become
Inheriting troubles, I'm mentally numb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something that just isn't fair

Hopin' they'll come out in some kinda manner that'll make the yakety sound

And you feel laid back and your hands start clappin'

Since you were seventeen

Didn't turn out like you planned

And I spent a lot of time

Is etched upon my mind
After all the things we've done and seen
You find another man

Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of fantastic LA

Concentrating on truckin' right

And I looked round in a state of fright
I saw four faces, one mad

They looked me up and down a bit
And turned to each other

I say

You got to show some respect
Don't you walk through my words

Well he looked down at my silver chain
He said I'll give you one dollar
I said you've got to be joking man
It was a present from me mother
He said I like it I want it
I'll take it off your hands
And you'll be sorry you crossed me
You'd better understand that you're alone
A long way from home

And I say
I don't like reggae, no no
I love it, yeah
I don't like reggae, no, no

Don't you cramp me style Don't you queer me pitch
Don't you walk through my words

Would you like something harder?

Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make the morning last
Just kicking down the cobblestones
Looking for fun and feelin' groovy
Ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da ... feelin' groovy

Hello, lamppost, whatcha knowing?
I've come to watch your flowers growing
Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?
Doot-in' doo-doo, feelin' groovy
Ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da ... feelin' groovy

I've got no deeds to do, no promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me
Life, I love you
All is groovy"

You're so hot, teasing me
So you're blue, but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
Ah, but girl, you're only a child

Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

Take it easy, take it easy
Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy, take it easy
Try to cool it, girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?

I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
Now you're so cute, I like your style
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile
Smile, but girl, you're only a child

Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe

Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night?
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistlin' tunes that you know and love so

Southern nights
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way, hey, yeah

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies? (In Southern sky)
Oh, its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes runnin' through your soul
Like the stories told of old

Old man
He and his dog that walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin' willows would cry for joy
Joy

Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

Mystery
Like this and many others in the trees
Blow in the night
In the Southern skies

Southern nights
They feel so good, it's a frightening
Wish I could (Southern nights)

Fish are rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
Say it might have been a fiddle or it could have been the wind
But there seems to be a beat now I can feel it my feet now
Listen here it comes again!
There's a band out on the highway
They're high stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands
Sun went down in honey
And the moon came up in wine
You know stars were spinning dizzy, Lord
The band kept us too busy we forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music played the band, Lord
They're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight
Balls of lighting roll along
Old men sing about their dreams
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playing on
Keep on dancing thru the daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No ones's noticed, but the band's all pack and gone
Was it ever there at all?
But they kept on dancing
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands
Well the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped"

Another chance he takes

Beware pretty faces you may find
A pretty face can hide an evil mind
Oh, careful what you say
Don't give yourself away

Then bleeding in a Bombay alley next day
And if the wrong word slips
While kissing persuasive lips

Where lies your heart?
It's not there in the buckskin, baby
It's not there in the gin that makes you laugh long and loud
You're a coward, James
You're running away from humanity
You're running out on reality
It won't be funny when they
Rat-a-tat-tat you down

The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

""You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the jailhouse rock with me""

Way over in the corner, weeping all alone

If you can't find a partner, use a wooden chair""

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ooh

Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind
In the garden, I see, west purple shower bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green
Pretty music, I hear, so happy and loud
Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
If you tried to ask, ""Or is it cool?"" (Is it cool?)
If you arrive and don't see me
I'm gonna be with my baby
I'm free, flyin' in her arms
Over the sea

Stained window, yellow candy screen
See speakers of kites
With velvet roses digging freedom flight

A present from you
Strawberry letter twenty-two
The music plays, I sit in for a few

Down in the valley on the foggy hill rock
Stood a crazy little demon blowing his top
Fire in his eyes and smoke from his head
You gotta be real cool to hear the words he said

He said ""mumgmbgugnbmglbubub""
""Mugmgmgugmgubumububmubmub""
""Mmmhmhmigngmgignungungjubugm""
That cat was mad

He had steam in his soul for the one he loved so
He had death on his mind 'cause Miss Demon let him go
Gonna run through the world 'til he understand his pain
Somebody help him get Miss Demon home again

He said ""mumgmbgugnbmglbubub""
""Mugmgmgugmgubumububmubmub""
""Mmmhmhmigngmgignungungnubumfng""
That cat, that cat was mad, yeah

He made the sky turn green, he made the grass turn red
He even put pretty hair on Grandma's bald head
He made the moon back up, he even pushed back time
He took the Frutti out of Tutti, he had the devil drinkin' wine

He said ""mumgmbgugnbmglbubub""
""Mugmgmgugmgubumububmubmub""
""Mmmhmhmigngmgignungungnubungub""

Miss Demon felt good 'cause she finally got across
To the crazy little demon that the woman still the boss
Down in the valley on the foggy hill rock
You can still hear the demon blowing his top

He said ""mumgmbgugnbmglbubub""
""Mugmgmgugmgubumububmubmub""
""Mmmhmhmigngmgignungungnubugmigng""

He pushed back, brought in afternoon
He even made Leap Year jump over the moon
He took the 4th of July and he put it in May
He took this morning for a drive yesterday

Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance, and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people, go

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget, no
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all, Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

Ooh, a-ha
Ooh, a-ha, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

This will be an everlasting love
This will be the one I've waited for
This will be the first time anyone has loved me, oh, oh, oh
I'm so glad you found me in time
And I'm so glad that you rectified my mind
This will be an everlasting love for me, oh, ho

Loving you is some kind of wonderful
Because you showed me just how much you care
You've given me the thrill of a lifetime
And made me believe you've got more thrills to spare, oh
This will be an everlasting love
Oh, yes, it will now

You brought a lot of a sunshine in to my life
You filled me with happiness I never knew
You gave me more joy than I ever dreamed of
And no one, no one can take the place of you
This will be you and me
Yes, siree
Eternally
Hugging and squeezing
And kissing and pleasing
Together forever through rain or whatever
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah you and me
So long as I'm living true love, I'll be giving
To you, I'll be serving
'Cause you're so deserving
Hey, you're so deserving

I made a good run but I went too slow
They over took me down in Juarez, Mexico
Sittin in the hop joint smoking my fill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said ""Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown'
Why you're the dirty hog that shot your woman down
Yes, oh yes my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
Shot her cold how she made me sore
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more
Put me on the train I was dressed in black
Lost the sheriff man it brought me back
Had no one to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail
And next morning along about nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
And he coughed as he cleared his throat
Come on you dirty hop into the district court

Into the court room the trial began
Where I was paneled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw the little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I thought, ""Oh lordy lordy have mercy on me""
The judge smiled as he picked u his pen
Ninety-nine years in that old San Quentin pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I'll never forget the day I shot my woman down
Come on you hops and listen up to me
Just lay off your whiskey and let that cocaine be"

And when I fight, you'd better run
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I'm goin' down in a middle of town
I'm goin' to shoot the first man down
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
My skin is hot as leather I'm as tough as any man
When I have to shave myself, I use an old tin can
I wash my face in boilin' wax and scrub myself with gunny sacks
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I'm mean - I'm mean - I'm mean
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I was raised on tiger's milk
I drink corn liquor and I smoke corn silk
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I chew up tin and I spit out nails
Sleep on snakes with ten-foot tails
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I started feelin' frisky
And I danced the other night
I fell so good, I took my gun and shot out ev'ry light

Now the Sheriff said, get out off town
Take him six feet under ground
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I'm mean - I'm mean - I'm mean
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I throwed my saddle on a grizzly bear
Then I crawled bare-handed in his mountain lair
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I cut my hair on a choppin' block
And when I chopped, the mountains rocked
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I tangled with a wild cat, just to proof that I was stout
Reached down his throat and grabbed his tail, then turned him inside out
Where I was raised, it's so darn tough
I had to leave, it got so rough
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun"

The cat I love has got the blues
'Cause his feet won't fit in his blue suede shoes

Oh barefoot baby, barefoot baby, he's no shoes
Barefoot baby, barefoot baby, barefoot baby
I love him so and I don't mean maybe
Got no leather for his feet
But my barefoot baby is oh so sweet

He can wiggle his hips, wiggle his nose
But the gals go crazy when he wiggles his toes

Oh barefoot baby, barefoot baby, he's no shoes
Barefoot baby, barefoot baby, barefoot baby
I love him so and I don't mean maybe
Got no leather for his feet
But my barefoot baby is oh so sweet


He's a real cool cat with his crew-cut hair
And the cats meow when his feet are bare

Oh barefoot baby, barefoot baby, he's no shoes
Barefoot baby, barefoot baby, barefoot baby
I love him so and I don't mean maybe
Got no leather for his feet
But my barefoot baby is oh so sweet


Each time we dance he says to me
""Kick your shoes off baby let your feet clap free""

Oh barefoot baby, barefoot baby, he's no shoes
Barefoot baby, barefoot baby, barefoot baby
I love him so and I don't mean maybe
Got no leather for his feet

It's astounding
Time is fleeting
Madness takes its toll
But listen closely
Not for very much longer
I've got to keep control
I remember doing the Time Warp
Drinking those moments when
The blackness would hit me
And the void would be calling

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

It's just a jump to the left
And then a step to the right
With your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

It's so dreamy
Oh, fantasy free me
So you can't see me
No, not at all
In another dimension
With voyeuristic intention
Well secluded, I see all
With a bit of a mind flip
You're into the time slip
And nothing can ever be the same
You're spaced out on sensation
Like you're under sedation

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

Well I was walking down the street
Just-a having a think
When a snake of a guy gave me an evil wink
He shook-a me up, he took me by surprise
He had a pick up truck and the devil's eyes
He stared at me and I felt a change
Time meant nothing, never would again

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

It's just a jump to the left
And then a step to the right
With your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again"

It be the B.T.J's, with lyrics for all
We be on point with the joints, 'cause we ain't taking no fall
So I'ma go for mine (So son, go for yours)
Yo, I'ma go for mine (So son, go for yours)

My crew be in the mix, like name brand kicks
The kids that only deal with that type of nonsense
You can't get wit, D.K.S. self evident
Adolescence, reign the supreme court, in any, every, meant

The time was approximately eleven forty three
When the D called me, and told me, we must be
Lyrically, the best that he says, the
K N O C K, and S and K, it's spray
Comin' away, the B.T.J., it be they
I'ma hold it down, with sounds
Like clowns, walk the trey pound
Now in the underground, B.T.J. just entered
Remember, the S comes last like December
Once shit cock it's time to Rock like the Monsta
In reality, B.T.J., is lyrically responsible for all difficulties

My lyrics oppose a threat to the best M.C. yet
And appears nightmares for those who slept
Also the biters, claimin they writers
They need to think about what they talk about
When you exposin' your dirt, that's when you dummin' out
Dwellin' in the PJ's, all day, hangin' out with nothin' to do
Them rebellin' niggas is mad, 'cause I'm tellin'' the truth
Hittin' yo with mind craftin', flows to molecular cord graphin

It be the B.T.J's, with lyrics for all
We be on point with the joints, 'cause we ain't taking no fall
So I'ma go for mine (So son, go for yours)
Yo, I'ma go for mine (So son, go for yours)
It be the B.T.J's, with lyrics for all
We be on point with the joints, 'cause we ain't taking no fall
So I'ma go for mine (So son, go for yours)
Yo, I'ma go for mine (So son, go for yours)

Aiyo one day it was me and the D
Walkin' down the street, some niggas stepped to me
Said are you Lil R-U-T-I-Z
He said I heard you nice on the muthafuckin' M-I-C
Battle me, battle right here, and let's see
So we kicked a verse that didn't hurt
So I hit 'em worst, to let him know I don't play those games
Save 'em for the jerks, D. Verbs said ""Son, let me get some""
I said ""No, 'cause he's a victim, and he probably in my premises
You know when I open my book with my lyrics I'm endin' this""
(No question) All this shit he poppin' in my ears
Fuckin' ejected, he can't hang with my style
Look now, here's man fillin' it, back to like what I was sayin
I start extortin', I'm not playin'
You want Lil Knock? I come on your block
Cock and then start sprayin', lyrics
So don't start what you can't finish
'Cause I will be sure to end whatever you created

Mentally you can't function
Physically you dead with the push of this button
Explosion be corruptin', from the expert of execution
I met Lil Knock at the junction
He was talkin' about walkin', to the tree spot
We took the L to New Rox, we got stopped by two cops
Talkin' about ""Where the two Glocks?"", we doo wops
How was I two Glocks? Man, it's too hot
And I'm cold, so let me go, I never hold
Whoever told you, that I do la?
Lil Sha, fuck a do or die
Nigga die, because of what they do
I do what I do with my crew
Po-po was hype, they was like ""You bite, stick with the mic device""
Drivin' off, said ""Have a good night""
Personally I might, and all that shit I said was a psych'

So who's the crew that give nightmares to those who slept (D.K.S.)
Constantly flown with finesse (D.K.S.)
Puttin' all comp' to rest (D.K.S.)
Be the best so you can't contest"

At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey


It took all the strength I had, not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Well, now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give

I went and bought myself a ticket
And I sat down in the very first row
They pulled the curtain
But then when they turned the spotlight way down low
Little Egypt came out struttin'
Wearing nothin' but a button and a bow

Singing, “Ying-yang, ying-yang
Ying-yang, ying-yang”

She had a ruby on her tummy
And a diamond big as Texas on her toe
She let her hair down
And she did the hoochie-coochie real slow
When she did her special number on the zebra skin
I thought she'd stop the show

Singing, “Ying-yang, ying-yang
Ying-yang, ying-yang”

She did her triple somersault, and when she hit the ground
She winked at the audience, and then she turned around
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine
Said, Phoenix, Arizona 1949

Yeah, but let me tell you people
Little Egypt doesn't dance there anymore
She's too busy mopping
And a-takin' care of shopping at the store
'Cause we've got seven kids
And all day long they crawl around the floor

Heh

And I ask you to kiss me again
When I reach for you, you jump clean outta sight
You change just like the wind

Hey, y'all, Little Richard's in town
I got the rock 'n' roll, and I'm gonna put it down
We got sister Bessy here tonight, from down there in Griffin, Georgia
She rode the bus all the way up here, just to see the beauty
We got brother George here tonight from down in Mexico
He skated all the way up here just to see the beauty
We got everybody here tonight
We got black folk, we got white folk
We got red folk, we got brown folk
We got yellow folk, we got real folk
We got love folk
I want y'all to know that I'm here tonight
And I've been talkin' about love for a long time
Because, honey, I'm the man that started it all
The emancipator of soul and the king of rock and roll
From Macon, Georgia
I want you to know that I'm here to be offered tonight in the fullness
That the beauty is still on duty
Let it all hang out
With the beautiful Little Richard from down in Macon, Georgia
I want you all to know that I am the Georgia peach
Let all the women folk say wooh (wooh)
Let all the men say ugh (ugh)
Ooh, my soul

A man walked up to me yesterday and say
""Little Richard, don't you know that James Brown can beat you at dancin'?""
I said ""Beat me dancin'? I suppose you ever thought about that he don't look like me?""
Shut up, I'm the star, and don't you ever forget it
But I'm here tonight to let you know
That it's time for everybody to have a good time
Shut up

Jeremiah was a bullfrog
Was a good friend of mine
I never understood a single word he said
But I helped him drink his wine
He always had some mighty fine wine

Joy to the world (Sing the song now)
All the boys and girls (Sing it, children)
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

You know I love the ladies (Yeah, you love the ladies)
Love to have my fun (Love to have your fun)

A straight-shooting son of a gun

I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the wars
And make sweet love to you

Shut up! I'd rather do it myself
Don't you know I'm the star
The only star, by far
Without a car, but I'm still a star
We're just like the lily, the rose, the sunflower and the medallion
The black, the white, the red, the brown and the yellow
Don't you know we are God's bouquet, the childrens of love?
If we had of made ourselves we woulda been somebody else
We're not here by chance, there is a purpose
And that's what the world needs today, is that purpose
The love purpose
The purpose to help all mankind
Make up their minds
To not believe nobody behind
But take all to everlasting happiness (joy)
Our purpose here tonight is that I got a message for you
A message of love and hope and peace
A message that every man, every woman, every boy, every girl need to hear
If you believe in it, wherever you are, want you to join in and sing this joyous song of love
Joy to the world (joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea)
Come on, let's sing, get it now (joy for you and me, everybody sing now)"

Now just because you're pretty
And you think you're mighty wise
You tell me that you love me
Then you roll those big brown eyes
When I saw you last week
Your eyes were turning black
Go find the guy that beats you up
Ask him to take you back

Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
I can tell you've been out on a spree
It's plain that you're lyin'
When you say that you've been cryin'
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me

Now I used to spend my money
To make you look real sweet
I wanted to be proud of you
When we walked down the street
Now don't ask me to dress you up
In satin and in silk
Your eyes look like two cherries
In a glass of buttermilk

Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
I can tell that you've been out on a spree
It's plain that you're lyin'
When you say that you've been cryin'
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me

Now I guess our little romance
Has finally simmered down
You should join a circus
You'd make a real good clown
Your eyes look like a roadmap
I'm scared to smell your breath
You'd better shut your peepers
Before you bleed to death

Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
I can tell you've been out on a spree
It's plain that you're lyin'

There ain't nothin' in the world like a big-eyed girl
To make me act so funny, make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose, like a long necked goose
Like a girl, oh baby, that's what I like

What's that baby?
But, but, but
Oh honey
But?
Oh baby, you know what I like

Chantilly Lace had a pretty face
And a pony tail a-hangin' down
A-wiggle and a-walk
And a-giggle and a-talk, Lord
Make the world go 'round, round, round
There ain't nothin' in the world like a big-eyed girl
To make me act so funny, make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose, like a long necked goose
Like a girl, oh baby, that's what I like

What's that, honey?
Pick you up at eight, and don't be late?
But, baby, I ain't got no money, honey
Ha ha ha ha
Oh, all right, honey, you know what I like

Chantilly Lace had a pretty face
And a pony tail a-hangin' down
A-wiggle and a-walk
And a-giggle and a-talk, Lord

Meeting Mr. Right, the man of my dreams
The one who shows me true love, or at least it seems
With brown cocoa skin and curly black hair
It's just the way he looks at me, that gentle loving stare

Finally you've come along
The way I feel about you, it just can't be wrong
If you only knew the way I feel about you
I just can't describe it, oh no no

Finally it has happened to me, right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally it has happened to me, right in front of my face and
I just cannot hide it
Finally it has happened to me, right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally it has happened to me, right in front of my face and
I just cannot hide it

It seems so many times you seemed to be the one
But all he ever wanted was to have a little fun
But now you've come along and brightened up my world
In my heart I feel it, I'm that special kind of girl

Finally you've come along
The way I feel about you, it just can't be wrong
If you only knew the way I feel about you
I just can't describe it, oh no no

Finally it has happened to me, right in front of my face

Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit
Of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware
That our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

So goodbye, dear, and Amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then

La rue
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ce matin dans la rue?
Une impression que rien ne va plus
Les gens n'ont rien à faire, ils sont libres comme l'air
Ils se jettent des regards éperdus
La rue
Elle est comme je ne l'avais jamais vue
Je suis nue et je marche sans but
Et mes os sont en papier
L'air debout sur le pavé
L'air est plein de parfums inconnus
Depuis demain
Jusqu'à hier, partout, toujours, que l'amour
Ivre de vie
Je m'envole et je crie, crie
La rue
Ce bruit sourd qui monte de la rue
Cette rumeur de la foule qui remue
Elle me presse, me soulève
Elle me tire de mes rêves
Me ramène à la réalité"

We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine

I say, we can go where we want to
A place where they'll never find
And we can act like we come from out of this world
Leave the real one far behind
We can dance (Danser!)

We can go where we want to
The night is young and so am I
And we can dress real neat
From our hats to our feet
And surprise 'em with a victory cry

I say, we can act if we want to
If we don't nobody will
And you can act real rude
And totally removed
And I can act like an imbecile

I say, we can dance, we can dance
Everything is out of control
We can dance, we can dance
We're doing it from pole to pole
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody look at your hands
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody's taking the chance
Safe to dance
Well it's safe to dance
Yes, it's safe to dance

We can dance if we want to
We've got all your life and mine
As long as we abuse it
Never gonna lose it
Everything will work out right

I say, We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine

I say, we can dance, we can dance
Everything is out of control
We can dance, we can dance
We're doing it from pole to pole

It isn't very hard to do
And you'll find happiness without an end
Whenever you pretend
Remember anyone can dream
And nothing's bad as it may seem
The little things you haven't got
Could be a lot if you pretend
You'll find a love you can share
One you can call all your own
Just close your eyes, she'll be there
You'll never be alone
And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend?
Instrumental interlude
And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend?"

We had a rainy day
I'm in a sneak-back situation
Here's a pencil pad
I'm gonna spread some information

You making me happier
Now I am snappier
While I'm with you
I got to be heavier
'Cause I am happier
When I make you

In my little sinfonia
(Singing blue Anna)
I get a dark blue ring
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I get a snapback raincoat
(Fourth of blue yonder)
I get a purple sting
('cos he is in tune)
Beside the whistle cat
(Singing the hour)
Along the frosty roadside
(Always in time)
I get another ring
(Making me happy)
That'll take me for another ride
(Up in the sky)

Oh, haven't you seen her?
(Riding by, she knows the high)

You making me happier
Now I am snappier
While I'm with you
I got to be heavier
'Cause I am happier
When I make you

Inside a dream storm
(Dreaming in and out of style)
Upon an eight o'clock sit down
(Dreaming for the other half so I can get on down)
Out in the country field, smiling
(Smiling, laughing, jumping fun)
I feel the love of a pretty sun
(Shining on me)

Laughing, having fun
Dreaming, laughing, smiling, having fun
Laughing, smiling, loving, get on down
Smiling, loving, burning, get on down"

Loving you, I'm never gonna change my mind
Loving you, I'm never gonna make you cry, I, I, I
I'll be by your side now and forever more
Whole life with joy and delight, ooh ooh

Don't you know I loved you from the start?
From the moment that we met
Long before I saw that smile of yours
I'm telling you from the bottom of my heart
You're the only one that I've been searching for
There was a time when I had lost my way
Couldn't find the lights surrounding me
I was almost frozen in the dark
You came along and gave me life again
You've warmed and opened up my broken heart

I'm never gonna change my mind
I'm loving you and I'm never gonna make you cry
(Won't make you cry)
Don't you know that I'll be by your side now and forever more
To fill you heart with joy and delight

Sometimes I made you feel all alone
When I'm too caught up in myself
Maybe I put you down in sorrow
But still you keep knocking at my door
And I know that you make me feel so strong
It's time for me to make you understand
I want to be with you, I'll be everything you want me to
So baby won't you give me another chance
So I can show you everything that I can do

I'm never gonna change my mind
I'm never gonna make you cry
(Won't make you cry)
Girl, I'll be by your side now and forever more
Fill your whole life with joy and delight
Every time we gotta make it through the rain
Every time things all turn out in vain
I swear I'll be by your side now and for ever more
To protect you from any kind of pain

Someone told me
And I agree that we were born in this world
To find one single, one single true
(One single true girl, it's you)
So stay right beside me
You know it's the way that we should be
I don't wanna think about what it'd would be
If we were to fall apart, oh

I'm never gonna change my mind
(And I'm never gonna change my mind)
Never gonna make you cry
(Said I'm never gonna make you cry, oh)
I'll be by your side forever more
Said I'll be by your side forever more
Fill your heart with joy and delight
Every, every, every time
Every time we gotta make it through the rain
(Gotta make it through)
Every time things turn all out in vain
(Turns out in vain)
I swear I'll be by your side now and for ever more
To protect you form any kind of pain, oh

Don't you know I loved you from the start?
Form the moment that we met
Long before I saw that smile of yours
I'm telling you from the bottom of heart
You're the only one that I've been searching for
You're the very one that I've been searching for
And I've been searching for a million years, it's you"

For the sake of man
He has forsaken his whole tan
Living, in the snow
Advancing how much we will know
But his heart cries out

Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you
Barbecutie, when you're with him he is warm

Let's pursue this more
Why would he leave so much that's warm
To his detriment
Maybe he's oh-so slightly bent
Well ask her, she would know

Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you
Barbecutie, when you're with him he is warm

The friends are getting friendly on the lawn
The flies are making enemies of all
Aroma rising from the ancient coals
Have turned you into someone very bold
And killed whatever hesitance she showed

Well, Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you
You, you, you

Though he's back unharmed
He must defrost his frozen charm
""How are you today""
That's very good, he's on his way
To the barbecue

Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you
Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you
Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you

Seek him here, seek him on the highway
Never knowing when he'll appear
All await, engine's ticking over
Hear the roar as they sense the fear
Wheels! A glint of steel and a flash of light
Screams! From a streak of fire as he strikes

Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather

Black as night, faster than a shadow
Crimson flare from a raging sun
An exhibition, sheer precision
Yet no one knows from where he comes
Fools! Self destruct cannot take that crown
Dreams! Crash one by one to the ground

Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather

There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried


There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
