Half-past twelve
And I'm watchin' the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowin' outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm livin' in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight


There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day"

Bright light city gonna set my soul
Gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher
There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
And they're all living the devil may care
And I'm just a devil with love to spare
So Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas

How I wish that there were more
Than the 24 hours in the day
Even if there were 40 more
I wouldn't sleep a minute away
Oh, there's blackjack and poker and the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on every deal
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas

Viva Las Vegas with you neon flashing
And your one arm bandits crashing
All those hopes down the drain
Viva Las Vegas, turning day into nighttime
Turning night into daytime
If you see it once
You'll never be the same again

I'm gonna keep on the run, I'm gonna have me some fun
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke, oh well, I'll always remember
That I had a swinging time
I'm gonna give it everything I've got
Lady luck please let the dice stay hot
Let me shoot a seven with every shot
Viva Las Vegas

I'm going 'round back, said she'd meet me there
We were rollin' in the grass that grows behind the barn
When my ears started ringin' like a fire alarm

The way they wiggle that thing really knocks me out
I'm gettin' high all the time, hope you all are too
C'mon little closer, gonna do it to you

Whoo

Well, the South side of Chicago is the baddest part of town
And if you go down there, you better just beware
Of a man named Leroy Brown
Now, Leroy, more than trouble
You see, he stands, about, six foot four
All the downtown ladies call him ""Treetop Lover""
All the men just call him ""Sir"" (Right on)

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

Now, Leroy, he's a gambler
And he likes his fancy clothes
And he liked to wave his diamond rings in front of everybody's nose
He got a custom Continental
He got an Eldorado too
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Well, Friday, about, a week ago
Leroy's shooting dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named Doris
And, ooh, that girl looked nice
Well, he casts his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
Leroy Brown, he learned a lesson about messing
With the wife of a jealous man

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Well, the two men took to fighting
And when they pulled them from the floor
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle with a couple of pieces gone

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog
And he‚Äôs bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Yeah, he was badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog"

I can't find a soul who'll take on this mess

Oh, get on up

I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia, California on my mind
I straddled that Greyhound and rode him into Raleigh and on across Caroline

We had motor trouble that turned into a struggle halfway across Alabam'
Well, the 'Hound broke down and left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

Right away, I bought me a through train ticket, riding across Mississippi clean
I was on that Midnight Flyer out of Birmingham, smoking into New Orleans

Somebody help me get out of Louisiana, just help me get to Houston town
There are people there who care a little about me and they won't let the poor boy down

Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit and put luggage in my hand
And I woke up high over Albuquerque on a jet to the promised land

A-workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte, flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes he would set us at the terminal gate

Swing low, chariot, come down easy, taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings and let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia, tidewater four-ten-o-nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling and the poor boy is on the line

A-workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte, flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes he would set us at the terminal gate

Swing low, chariot, come down easy, taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings and let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia, tidewater four-ten-o-nine

With life in place, the chains are on a countdown to break. Artificial condition known as life
Destruction! The origin of a destructive path. An obscure destructive path. Artificial condition
Pathetic intelligence. Pathetic intelligence has been injected into the selected beings. Their minds are connected, but rarely direct–µd. Negatively affect–µd, all due to the pain of being completely neglected
Confined and withering into the abyss
An obscure path that never mattered. Like bloody glass that‚Äôs been shattered
It‚Äôs melting through the hands of the useless souls. Useless souls
This imaginary earth that no one truly controls. Controls!
Fear for the sky, where the blood is collected. Where the blood is collected
One by one, they were all wired into the thought of terror
Watching the earth melt through the hands of the weak as they are all isolated in fear
Now no words remain for those who have never had the chance to complain
A slave they remain, with nothing to gain. A slave they remain, with nothing to gain. Placed into the sky for their blood to rain... to rain
This reality; beyond insane. Beyond insane!
Forcefully thrown in, and forcefully erased. Forcefully thrown in, and forcefully erased. With no choice but to be forgotten. The sky was meant to rest the ones that are well past rotten. Forcefully thrown in
There is no way to return. The time will come. The fragile world will grow feeble
Inevitable! Inevitable, but mandatory to live in fear of this territory. Live in fear of this territory

Sight from the top, with so much height that won‚Äôt stop. Fiction or constriction?
A thought so aggressive, has conformed into addiction. A thought so aggressive, has conformed into addiction. Forced! Not to be taken for granted. Forced! Not to be taken for granted. Walk this earth while you can. I think good
Those with control will obliterate the weak. Those with control will obliterate the weak
As the prosthetic souls enter their bodies, the world will shake
With life in place, the chains are on a countdown to break. A countdown to break. Artificial condition known as life
Weakness will reveal with the inability to determine what‚Äôs real. What‚Äôs real!
Control must be earned. Power must be taken, in order to reawaken
The weak into power. The power into control. The control turned to rage
This war has just begun! This hatred built from power. A desire to kill
Their lives are flashing back for their final hour. Nothing could have changed this circumstance
Run as far as you can, but they will all collapse regardless. They will all collapse
Desire for the throne, the weak have no right to remain conscious
One by one, they will be set free
One by one, they will be set free and join the nonexistent entity
A dishonorable defeat. The fear is constantly racing through their minds. They keep running, but eventually there will be no place left to hide
No place left to hide. Surpassing the misery and endless images of horror that was once unimaginable
No place left to hide. Surpassing the misery
No place left to hide. Surpassing the misery of horror that was once unimaginable
It has become a traumatizing reality. Trauma! Trauma! It has become a traumatizing reality

Pathetic intelligence has been injected into the selected beings. Their minds are connected, but rarely directed. Negatively affected, all due to the pain of being completely neglected
The dark will never end. The light was but a dream. The light was but a dream
Only to be heard. It is all just a dream. Never to be true. Never to be true
The cowards hit the bottom
The cowards hit the bottom as their blood runs through the cracks on the floor
Finally, what‚Äôs inside the skull is connected to the earth
Finally, what‚Äôs inside the skull is connected to the earth
Only then will they realize that this world has been hopeless
Sinking. Sinking. They‚Äôre all sinking. Sinking into corruption. Sinking into insanity
Nothing was meant to be. Nothing was meant to be fair
Driven by the neglect. Driven by the neglect
The world will shake. The world will shake
Inevitable, but mandatory to live in fear of this territory
The world will shake. The world will shake
Restless eyes forced open to observe. To observe
Restless eyes forced open to observe and indulge in the Hell on this earth. A pointless earth for the ones who have fallen. This is suffering. Years of suffering. Fear! Pain!
With nothing to gain, the superior will reign. Death!
No way to numb the suffering. No way to numb the suffering
The pain won‚Äôt... The pain won‚Äôt go away. Away!
Accepting defeat is only the beginning of pain... of pain!
Their limbs so frail. Their flesh so pale
All of the recent torment is here to stay
All of the recent torment and shock has caused this distress. Nothing left to regret, nothing left to regret, just embrace the pain that you will never forget
Accepting defeat is only the beginning of pain... of pain!
Their limbs so frail. Their flesh so pale
All of the recent torment... is here to stay
Overrated. Unrelated. Our race overpopulated. Frail!
Their limbs so frail. Their limbs so frail. Their flesh so pale
All of the recent torment is here to stay
No way to numb the suffering
An overrated humanity, designed to be wasted until time depletes. As time depletes

Break these chains. No way to numb
As the prosthetic souls enter their bodies, the world will shake
With life in place, the chains are on a countdown to break. Artificial condition known as life
Artificial condition, a false reality
Artificial condition, a false reality
Fear for the sky, where the blood is collected. Where the blood is collected
One by one, they were all wired into the thought of terror
Resorting to chaos. A solution so pure. The race designed for worms
The race designed for filthy worms
Pathetic and worthless dreamlike state of mind
Consuming all of the irrelevant sensations. Consuming all, until there is nothing
Replacing lives with more lives. Replacing lives with no lives. Animalistic tendencies absorbing all
Replacing lives with more lives. Replacing lives with no lives. Animalistic tendencies absorbing all
Dispose all of the senseless and miserable individuals
Dispose all of the senseless. A solution so pure. So pure
Pathetic and worthless dreamlike state of mind
Deception at its finest
Resorting to chaos. A solution so pure. The race designed for worms
Don‚Äôt question the walls beneath your fragile skin. Unbearable is all that‚Äôs known on this Hell
Destined to break. Destined to break! Break!
Beyond contorted with no solution
They‚Äôll be trapped forever as the blood they shed is poured out from the heart, into their coffin
Devour and destroy the cowards. The beginning of a wasteland for those who don‚Äôt listen
Ignorant as can be, a brainwashed society
The vulnerable will never be prepared to enter the burial ground. Ground
The thought of the inevitable plans are bleak and desirable
The disconnection of this filthy atmosphere has left uncertainty, and desperation
Ignorant as can be, a brainwashed society
The vulnerable will never be prepared to enter the burial ground
They‚Äôll be trapped forever as the blood they shed is poured out from the heart, into their coffin
Watch them fall apart
So it goes to show, the superior will reign. Reign Hell forever
To indulge in showing absolutely no remorse, is what defines the craved satisfaction
Reign! Reign! Reign Hell forever! Reign Hell!
Temper so vile. Inflicting endless pain
Reign Hell forever! Inflicting endless pain
Tortured forever. Reign Hell forever!
Prosthetic soul, break these chains! Exit this body once and for all!"

Take off your shoes and pat your feet
We're doin' a dance that can't be beat

We're barefootin'
We're barefootin'
We're barefootin'

Went to a party the other night
Long Tall Sally was out of sight
Threw away her wig, and her high sneakers, too
She was doin' a dance without any shoes

She was barefootin'
She was barefootin'
She was barefootin'
She was barefootin'

Hey, little girl with your red dress on
I bet you can barefoot all night long
Take off your shoes and throw 'em away
Come back and get 'em another day

We're barefootin'
We're barefootin'
We're barefootin'
We're barefootin'

Everybody get barefootin'
Take off your shoes

Li'l John Henry, he said to Sue
""If I was barefootin' would you barefoot, too""?
Sue told John, ""I'll stir your stew
I was barefootin' ever since I was two""

They were barefootin'

Big fun to be had by everyone

Young and old are doing it, I'm told
Just one try, and you too will be sold

Like the days of stomping at the Savoy
Now we freak, oh, what a joy
Just come on down, two 54
Find a spot out on the floor
Ah, freak out!

Well, here I am and who's to say?

Just one chance and I will show you love

On your ladder, I'll be a peg

We can take some shelter
I'd like to hold your little hand
My head is spinning like a helter-skelter
We'll get to know each other if we can

She said, hey - just a little bit - hold on
Whenever I try to think of what it feels like
To feel it for the first time, was it really such a thrill?
She said, look, boy - but don't you touch
That ain't much - it's only a school boy crush

Got to keep this secret - I can't take no chance
Don't want nobody else to know
There is nothing wrong with trying to start a romance
We should take it nice and slow
If we play it cool (If we play it cool), it'll be all right
Don't let the teacher see us talking
But after school we can be out of sight
Everybody gonna think we just gone walkin'

Arrived here this morning, won't be here for long
As fast as a shooting star, that's' what them eight wheels are for
Come on and jump aboard
It's a mean piece of transport baby
You know that's no joke
On board the aging gambler smiles as he peels
The seal off a new deck, then he quietly deals
Hands round the table from the bottom he slips three
Watch yourself if you play this game the fastest card game on wheels
Come on, won't you be there when it leaves
Can't you hear them talkin' about it
Together we could race the breeze
It shines out a light, in the darkest night
To make us feel alright
To make us feel alright
I've prayed every night
That you will wanna go there too
Come on darlin', let's go
Night is over as the dawn begins to crack
Sounds like a hen hatching in a chicken shack
Late last night I think I heard a lonely cry
Heard the blind owl howling in a moonlit sky

Come on
Won't you be there when it leaves
Can't ya hear me talkin'
Together we could race the breeze
Old engine driver never stepped on the ground
Got no degree in geography but he's been around
Knows all the back lines, eyes can hardly see
Don't tell this man to slow down
'Cause he don't know what you mean
Alright
Won't you be there when it leaves
Can't you hear me cryin' honey
Together we can race the breeze
It shines out a light, in the darkest night
To make us feel alright
To make us feel alright
I've prayed every night
That you will wanna go there too
Well that sounds like the night train, blowin' its stack
Spreading its wheels on homeward track
Arrived here this morning, won't be long
As fast as a shooting star, that's' what them eight wheels are for

Together we can race the breeze
Can't you hear me talkin' baby
We can race the breeze
Don't you hear me talkin' honey
We can race the breeze
Hear me talkin' baby
We can race the breeze"

Up above my head
I saw something
It was the most beautiful thing I‚Äôd ever seen
In my life
I spoke out loud
I said
You know you are the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life
I heard a voice tell me
I heard a voice say to me
It said ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù
I said ‚ÄúI want to change it
Because it‚Äôs wrong
I want to change it
Because I believe it can be better‚Äù
The voice said to me
‚ÄúWhat makes you think
That you are man enough
To change anything?‚Äù
I thought for awhile
And then I spoke out loud
And I said to it
I said...
‚ÄúBecause I am a man
And I am a part of the things that are wrong
And if this world must go on
I have to put it right
And I know
Just by lookin‚Äô at you, baby
That you‚Äôre superior to me
And you can help me
Give me the answers
Give me some answers‚Äù
She turned around to me
You know what she said
She said ‚ÄúI can help you
But there‚Äôs something I want from you, is a gift
In return
For the information I can give
I want a gift from you
I want a gift from you
I tried my very best to look up to the sky
And then I realized I had no eyes
I was blind
Totally blind
I begin to get afraid
Afraid of the dark
I was afraid
Afraid in the darkness
But then I thought about my friends
Who have no eyesight
I thought about the world they live in
And how much it‚Äôs nice there
How good it made me feel
I was not afraid
I was not afraid anymore
I spoke up louder
I said ‚ÄúListen
You‚Äôve got my eyesight
There isn‚Äôt much more I can give
Now tell me, how do I change it?‚Äù
The voice said back
‚ÄúOh yes there is
We want something more than your eyesight‚Äù
I thought for a while
And I thought
‚ÄúWhat more could she want than my eyes?‚Äù
And then the terrible feeling crept over me
As I began to realize that I understood what she was talkin' 'bout
I screamed out loud!
Said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not-a-give up my life!
I‚Äôd love to give you my life
But I‚Äôm just a young man
And I have a wife
I have a wife and a baby
And if I die
I know they‚Äôll cry
So please don‚Äôt take my life
Then I heard my wife say
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right baby
I understand
Go ahead and do your thing!‚Äù
There was nowhere I could run
I heard my father say
‚ÄúI understand son
Go ahead and give it
It‚Äôs yours to give.‚Äù
Then I heard my mother say the same thing
She said
‚ÄúGo ahead and give it away
I gave to you
And now it‚Äôs yours to give to someone else‚Äù
I was lost
I was lost
No place to run, no place to hide
No place to run no place to hide
I felt it
I knew it
I could sense it
I could feel it
Creeping up from the tips of my toes
Up my legs
Over my knees
Up over my belly
'Cross my chest
The black shadow
Of death
No place to run, no place to hide
So I just laid there and I died
Died, died

You may find yourself
Living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself
In another part of the world
And you may find yourself
Behind the wheel of a large automobile
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house
With a beautiful wife
And you may ask yourself
""Well ... how did I get here?""

Letting the days go by
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by
Water flowing underground
Into the blue again
After the money's gone
Once in a lifetime
Water flowing underground
And you may ask yourself
""How do I work this?""
And you may ask yourself
""Where is that large automobile?""
And you may tell yourself
""This is not my beautiful house!""
And you may tell yourself
""This is not my beautiful wife!""

Letting the days go by
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by
Water flowing underground
Into the blue again
After the money's gone
Once in a lifetime
Water flowing underground

Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was

Water dissolving, and water removing
There is water at the bottom of the ocean
Under the water, carry the water
Remove the water at the bottom of the ocean
Water dissolving, and water removing

Letting the days go by
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by
Water flowing underground
Into the blue again
Into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones
There is water underground
Letting the days go by
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by
Water flowing underground
Into the blue again
After the money's gone
Once in a lifetime
Water flowing underground

You may ask yourself
""What is that beautiful house?""
You may ask yourself
""Where does that highway go to?""
And you may ask yourself
""Am I right? Am I wrong?""
And you may say to yourself
""My God! What have I done?!""

Letting the days go by
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by
Water flowing underground
Into the blue again
Into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones
There is water underground
Letting the days go by
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by
Water flowing underground
Into the blue again
After the money's gone
Once in a lifetime
Water flowing underground

Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it, ever was
And look where my hand was
Time isn't holding up
Time isn't after us
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Letting the days go by
Same as it ever was
And here, a twister comes, here comes the twister

WRITER DAVE BURGESS
Now there's a little place that I know about
I go there with my baby everytime I take her out
We park by the rock and watch the lights down below
And I tell her things that she ought to know
They call it Lover's rock, they call it Lover's rock
Well, everybody's rockin' and there's very little talkin'
Just a-huggin' and a-kissin' goin' on
I just can't wait for Saturday night
We'll park by the rock in the pale moonlight
I'll grab my baby and steal a kiss and then
I know she'll be stealin' it right back again
They call it Lover's rock, they call it Lover's rock
Well, everybody's rockin' and there's very little talkin'
Just a-huggin' and a-kissin' goin' on
Well, everybody's got a little place they call their own
Where they can always go when they wanna be alone
Lover's rock is the best around
It's a short way up but it's a long way down
They call it Lover's rock, they call it Lover's rock
Well, everybody's rockin' and there's very little talkin'
Just a-huggin' and a-kissin' goin' on

I called the teacher cause I wanted to confess it now
Can I make the time for me to come and get it blessed somehow
She spoke to me in such a simple and decisive tone
Her sweet admission left me feeling in position from

I don't take these things so personal, anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible, anymore

Somebody hooted and they hollered, ""Can I buy a vowel""
Don't let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel
And when it's not as it appears to be, the flagrant foul
Can I put my fingers in your mouth before you start to growl

I don't think that it's so terrible, anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable, anymore

Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin

Sometimes I feel like I'm a sentimental trooper
She cried so hard, you know she looked like Alice Cooper

I don't think that it's so personal, anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible, anymore

Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin

I'm kissin' high and low, our bodies like two dominoes
Can I come and get you when I hit you in your party clothes
Let's turn this cosplay holiday, what we obey
And now we're welcoming each other to this cabaret

I don't think that it's so terrible, anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable, anymore

Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin

I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding
Opened the door up and to my surprise, there, you were standing
Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar?
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
And I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never, ne-ne-never
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop

‚ÄúSon, you gotta make some money
If you wanna use the car

Well, I didn't go to work
Told the boss I was sick
‚ÄúNow you can't use the car

Gonna have a fine vacation
I'm gonna take my problem

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called ""life""
Electric word, life
It means forever, and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else:
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-All-Right
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, babe
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor)
Whoo

If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see, I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
""Ah, ah,"" is all I heard

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go
Come..

We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for? (What's it all for?)
You better live now
'Fore the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go

C'mon, baby
Let's get nuts
Yeah

Let's go crazy

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go
Go (Go crazy)
Whoo!

I said let's go crazy (Go crazy)
Let's go (Let's go)

You will hear your conscience grumble

Watchin' flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from payin' dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues. Yeh!
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today
She said her name was Billy Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
""Go on, my friend, do anything you choose.""
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billy Jean was waitin' when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
He just might find himself out there on horseback in the dark
Just ridin' and runnin' across those desert sands"

It was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly
Love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
""C'est la vie,"" say the old folks
It goes to show, you never can tell

They furnished off an apartment with
A two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed
With TV dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work
The little money comin' worked out well
""C'est la vie,"" say the old folks
It goes to show, you never can tell

They had a hi-fi phono
Boy, did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records
All rock, rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell
""C'est la vie,"" say the old folks
It goes to show, you never can tell

They bought a souped-up jitney
Was a cherry red '53
And drove it down to Orleans
To celebrate their anniversary
It was there where Pierre
Was wedded to the lovely madamoiselle

You know this boogie is for real...

I used to put my faith in worship
But then my chance to get to Heaven slipped
I used to worry about the future
But then I threw my caution to the wind
I had no reason to be carefree - no, no, no
Until I took a trip to the other side of town - yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I heard that boogie rhythm
Hey! I had no choice but to get down, down, down, down

Dance!
Nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through, just dance
Got canned heat in my heels, tonight, baby

I feel the thunder, see the lightning
I know this anger's Heaven-sent
So I've got to hang out all my hang-ups
'Cause on the boogie, I feel so Hell-bent, hey, hey
It's just an instant gut reaction, that I get
I know I've never, ever felt like this before
I don't know what to do
But, man, that's nothing new
Stuck between Hell and high water
I need a cure to make it through, hey!

Dance, yeah
Nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through, just dance, hey
Got canned heat in my heels, tonight, baby
You know, know, know I'm gonna dance, yeah
Off the nasty things that people say, dance, yeah
But I'm gonna make it anyway
(Dance) Yeah, got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
You know I got canned heat in my heels

You know this boogie is for real

Only the wind can know the answers
And she cries to me when I'm asleep
She says ""you know that you can go much faster""
I know that people's talk can be so cheap, hey hey
I've got this voodoo child enveined on me
I'm gonna use my power to ascend
You know I've got these running heels to use
So, child, there's no way I'll lose
I was born to run and built to last
You'll never see my feet 'cause they move so fast

Dance, yeah, hey
Nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through, just dance, hey
Got canned heat in my heels, tonight, baby

Meant more to me before the day I found you

Oh, girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you

Here in your arms, I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now, I think I would die
Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time

More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me

Oh, now there are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking 'bout those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again

This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love, I know I would die
Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time

More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
Hey
More than a woman (Ooh)
More than a woman to me (Oh, so much more)
More than a woman (Oh, babe)

Puso un baile una jut√≠a, para una gran diversi√≥n
De timbalero un rat√≥n, que alegraba el campo un d√≠a
Un gato tambi√©n ven√≠a, elegante y placentero
'Buenas noches, compa√±ero' siempre dijo as√≠ el timbal
'Para alguien aqu√≠ poder tocar para descansar un poco'
Sali√≥ el rat√≥n medio loco, 'tambi√©n voy a descansar'
Y el gato en su buen bailar, bailaba un danz√≥n liviano
El rat√≥n se subi√≥ al guano y dice bien placentero:

¬°Y ahora si quieren bailar, busquen otro timbalero!

Ay candela, candela, candela, me quemo a√©

If I were to say to you:
""Can you keep a secret?""
Would you know just what to do
Or where to keep it?
Then I say, ""I love you""
Foul the situation
Hey, girl, I thought we were the right combination

Who broke my heart?
You did, you did
Bow to the target
Blame Cupid, Cupid
You think you're smart?
Stupid, stupid

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow
Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow

No rhythm in cymbals, no tempo in drums
Love on arrival, she comes when she comes
Right on the target but wide of the mark
What I thought was fire was only the spark
The sweetest melody is an unheard refrain
So lower your sights
Yeah, but raise your aim, raise your aim

Who broke my heart?
You did, you did
Bow to the target
Blame Cupid, Cupid
You think you're smart?
Stupid, stupid

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow
Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow

I thought you loved me
But it seems you don't care
I care enough to know
I can never love you

Who broke my heart?
You did, you did
Bow to the target
Blame Cupid
You think you're smart?
That's stupid
Right from the start
When you know we would part

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow
Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow

Heart, shoot that poison arrow
Shoot that poison arrow"

I took my troubles down to Madame Ruth
You know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth
We lost you on Madame Ruth, you got too soft bill. Keep singin' out. And every, helm, helm, you don't get any softer on any of those other cuts. This is it, this is the tempo and that's the grove, okay? Take sixteen

I took my troubles down to Madame Ruth
You know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth
She's got a pad on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
Sellin' little bottles of Love Potion No. 9

I told her that I was a flop with chicks
I've been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
She said, ""What you need is Love Potion No. 9""

She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink
She said, ""I'm gonna mix it up right here in the sink""
It smelled like turpentine and looked like India ink
I held my nose, I closed my eyes (I took a drink)

I didn't know it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight
But when I kissed a cop at Thirty-Fourth and Vine
He broke my little bottle of Love Potion No. 9


I held my nose, I closed my eyes (I took a drink)

I didn't know it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight
I had so much fun that I'm goin' back again
I wonder what'll happen with Love Potion No. 10

Moves us to the nth hoop

Your love, I'll keep forevermore
(You're the first) You're the first (The last), you're the last, my everything

In you, I found so many things
A love so new only you could bring
(Can't you see it's you, you, you?) Can't you see it's you? You make me feel this way
You're like a first morning dew on a brand new day

I see so many ways that I
Can love you 'til the day I die
You're my reality
Yet I'm lost in a dream
(You're the first) You're the first (The last), the last, my everything

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
Girl, you're my reality
But I'm lost in a dream
You're the first (The last), you're the last (My everything), my everything

You and me, babe
It's you and me
And you are the first, the last, my everything"

L'ho beccata in discoteca con lo sguardo da serpente
Io mi sono avvicinato, lei gi√† non capiva niente
L'ho guardata, m'ha guardato e mi sono scatenato
Fred Astaire al mio confronto era statico e imbranato
Le ho sparato un bacio in bocca, uno di quelli che schiocca
Sulla pista indiavolata, l√¨ per l√¨ l'ho strapazzata
L'ho lanciata, riafferrata, senza fiato l'ho lasciata
Tre le braccia mi √® cascata, era cotta e innamorata
Per i fianchi l'ho bloccata e ne ho fatto marmellata
Oh yeah, si dice cos√¨, no? E poi, e poi

Che idea
Ma quale idea, non vedi che lei non ci sta?
Che idea
Ma quale idea, √® maliziosa, ma sapr√† tenere a bada un super bullo buffo come te
E poi che avresti di speciale che in un altro, no, non c'√®?
Che idea
Ma quale idea, non vedi che lei non ci sta?
Che idea
Ma quale idea, attento, lei lunga la sa
Lei ti far√† girare in tondo senza avere mai
Le cose che pretendi e scusa, in fondo scusa, tu che dai?

M'√® venuta una pensata, nella tana I'ho portata
Le ho versato un'aranciata, lei s'e fatta una risata
Al mio whisky si √® aggrappata e cinque litri s'√® scolata
Mi sembrava bella e andata, m'ha baciato, I'ho baciata
Ad un tratto I'ho agganciata, dalle braccia m'e sgusciata
M'ha guardato, I'ho guardata, l'ho bloccata, accarezzata
Sul visino suo di fata, ma sembrava una patata
L'ho acchiappata, I'ho frullata e ne ho fatto una frittata
Oh yeah, si dice cos√¨, no? E poi

Che idea
Ma quale idea, non vedi che lei non ci sta?

You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will but what a thrill
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

I laughed at love 'cause I thought it was funny
You came along and you moved me, honey
I've changed my mind, this love is fine
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

You kiss me, baby
Woah, it feels good
Hold me, baby
Girl, love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
But I'ma tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I get nervous, but it sure is fun
Come on, baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire


Well, kiss me, baby
Woah, it feels good
Hold me, baby
I wanna love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
I gotta tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

You were the answer to all my dreams

I got your number, and I called you on the phone
Your sister lied and said that you were not at home
Burning desire with every letdown
And I'm trying not to go crazy

What am I to do, I can't get close to you
I'd love, I'd love, I'd love, I'd love, I'd love

A-hey, do it now, huh
Yeah, hey

Hey-ah, once I was a boogie singer
Playing in a rock and roll band
I never had no problems, yeah
Burning down the one-night stands
Then everything around me, yeah
It got to start to feeling so low
And I decided quickly, yes, I did, heh
To disco down and check out the show

Yeah, they were dancing and singing
And moving to the grooving
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

""Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die"", heh heh
'Til you die, yeah (What?)
Hear, hear, heh

A-heh, I tried to understand this (Yeah)
Heh, I thought that they were out of their minds
Heh, how could I be so foolish, how could I
To not see I was the one behind?
So still I kept on fighting
Well, losing every step of the way (Hey, what'd you do?)
I said, ""I must go back there"", I got to go back
And check to see if things still the same

Yeah, they were dancing and singing
And moving to the grooving
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

""Play that funky music, white boy (Yeah)
Play that funky music right, oh
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die"", heh
'Til you die (Yeah)
Woah, 'til you die
Gonna play some electrified funky music, yow!

Ah ha ha

Hey, wait a minute, now first it wasn't easy
Changing rock and roll and minds
Yeah, things were getting shaky
(Yeah) I thought I'd have to leave it behind, uh
Ooh, but now it's so much better, it's so much better
I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feeling, no, I won't
Of how I learned my lesson that day

When they were dancing and singing
And moving to the grooving
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

""Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die"", heh heh

I believe in miracles, baby
I believe in you

I believe in you

They say the day is ending
Let's watch the Sun go down
And plan a holiday for two
For all eternity
We'll ride a cloud so you can see
The world I created just for you

Oh, I saw you standing on the street
I wanted to meet, just stop a while
You give me a smile to say hello
You made me feel so good inside
That I realized that I couldn't hide
The feeling that came when you failed to say

I believe in miracles
I believe in miracles
I believe in miracles
Don't you, don't you?

I believe in miracles, baby
I believe in you
I believe in miracles, baby
I believe in you

I don't know what people are saying
Or what games that they are playing
Or if they're playing that same old game on me
People never knowing where they're going or what they're showing
So, come on boys, show a little love for me

I believe in miracles
I believe in miracles
I believe in miracles
Don't you, don't you?

I believe in miracles
I believe in miracles
I believe in miracles
Don't you, don't you?

Here we are together, face to face
Forever in a place that I created
Just for you, you, you
So, people are better than what you give
Believe in dreams and think they're real
And, one day soon, your miracles will come true

I believe in miracles (Dont you?)

And I've always had your tender lips

I graduated from the college in‚ÄÖthe‚ÄÖstreet
Inflation in the‚ÄÖnation don't bother me
'Cause I'm a‚ÄÖscholar when it comes to the almighty dollar
Money, money, money, money is...
Money's on my mind
Money, money, money moves me
I even like the money sign
I'm so mean with the green
I make a dollar wanna holler
Make a mark wanna bark
Make a pound wanna frown
Money, money, money, money is...

Ain't no such thing as dirty money
The rich folks know what I mean
And money ain't got no smell, let me tell you
How green can keep you clean
Money, money, money, money is...
Money's on my mind
Money, money, money moves me
I even like the money sign

So mean with the green
I make a yen wanna grin
Make a franc wanna clank
Make a twenty look plenty
Money, money, money, money is...
The only thing that's on my mind
I'd rather be well-to-do
Than have to I-O-U
I think my friend, brother Getty would agree
There's only one thing that money can't buy
And that is poverty
Money, money, money, money is...
Money's on my mind
Money, money, money moves me
I even like the money sign
Money, money, money, money is...
Money's on my mind
I'm a stone-cold taker
I'm a piggy-bank shaker
I use every ruse, talking trash
So if you go to my school
You got to learn to this rule
Don't let your mouth write a check
That your body can't cash

Money, money, money, money is...
Money's on my mind
Money, money, money moves me
I even like the money sign
I'm so mean with the green
I make a dollar wanna holler
Make a mark wanna bark
Make a pound wanna frown
Money, money, money, money is...

My eyes start to blinkin' when I flash on some Lincolns
My mind starts relaxin' when my pocket is full of Jacksons"

What's the sense in sharing this one and only life
Ending up just another lost and lonely wife?
You count up the years
And they will be filled with tears
Love only breaks up to start over again
You'll get the babies
But you won't have your man
While he is busy loving every woman that he can, uh-huh

Say I'm gonna leave
A hundred times a day
It's easier said than done
When you just can't break away
(Just can't break away)

Oh! Young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me
My man and me
Oh! Young hearts
To yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you

It's high time now, just one crack at life
Who wants to live in trouble and strife
My mind must be free to learn all I can about me, mmm
I'm gonna love me for the rest of my days
Encourage the babies every time they say
Self-preservation is what's really going on today

Say I'm gonna turn loose
A thousand times a day
How can I turn loose
When I just can't break away
(When I just can't break away)

Oh! Young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me

Got to boogie down
Boogie fever

She turned the speaker down
And then she turned on the radio
I watched a silent movie digging funky sound

She likes to boogie down
Uh huh, she's got the boogie fever
I think it's going around
I took my baby to the pizza parlor (Pizza parlor)
To get a bite to eat.  Ah, ah, ah

All night long, we did the bump, bump, bump
Yes we did, yes we did, yes we did, yeah.  (Yeah.)
She kept it going strong doing the bump, bump, bump

I called my doctor on the telephone.  (Doctor, doctor)
Said doctor, doctor, please, I-I-I
I got this feeling rocking and a-reeling

Girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
A part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you
Here in your arms, I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now, I think I would die

Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time (Minute at a time)
You are

More than a woman to me (Baby)

Shoo-doo, doo-doo
More than a woman

There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
(Let history repeat itself)
Reflecting how I feel for you
I'm thinking 'bout those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love, I know I would die

Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time (Minute at a time)

(Emme - a - erre - ka', M - A - R - K)

Apro il telefono, ci sono due vie
Due file di barre scritte non avendo nient'altro
Vivo in freestyle e mi dico: ""Carpe diem""
Se posso spaccare il palco chiedo: ""Perch√© non farlo?""
Binario 55 'n chill with my guys
E non voglio pi√π avere i tuoi problemi (No, no)
Binario 55 'n chill with my guys
Nella mia testa ho fuso i due emisferi

Mi alzo dal letto e fermo la sveglia che suona (click!)
Mentre scazzo in dialetto lo schermo segna che √® ora
Sforno in cassa il biglietto per il ritorno da Roma
Fr–µmo e aspetto quel tr–µno che passa una volta sola
E becco Gab in stazione, non il plug, rimastone
Ieri al club, fighe storie, scleri e rap, mica cover
Dice ""Fre', nel mercato c'√® un'intossicazione (Eh s√¨ eh)
Vige il cash sperperato, e noi siam mossi dal cuore""
E allora scrivo e fillo in giro sul Flixbus
Certi eventi e sentimenti per far rendita
Hai zero identit√†, qui perdi i denti, fra'
E se incido al micro uccido ma ho l'indennit√† (Pow, pow!)
Qui hai la cr√®me de la cr√®me della Puglia
Ogni traccia che ho √® pi√π hot della 'nduja (Hot)
Usare ogni beat come ring dalla culla
Poi mi ha reso Mark, peso Max, Alleluia (Alleluia)
Se capisci il divario, allora, com'√® che spacchi?
Il mio flow √® magia, va via, strofe mad-maxi
Sparisci come sul binario 9¬æ
Aria sana in cypha a fare in 9 i 3/4
E quindi dai (dai)
Non ti smentisci mai
Babbo, spingi hype e manco stringi il mic
Scarso, fingi ai live, passo da Fifty a Styles
E aspetto avaro l'orario al Binario 55

Apro il telefono, ci sono due vie
Due file di barre scritte non avendo nient'altro
Vivo in freestyle e mi dico: ""Carpe diem""
Se posso spaccare il palco chiedo: ""Perch√© non farlo?""
Binario 55 'n chill with my guys
E non voglio pi√π avere i tuoi problemi
Binario 55 'n chill with my guys
Nella mia testa ho fuso i due emisferi

Sei un pisciazzo, no' uno spara spara (Pam)
Il rione mi d√† sempre pi√π di una favela, seh
Un bimbo √® in strada se la strada paga
Mi proteggo dai demoni, Cruz de Caravaca
Io non disso chi √® sconfitto, vado dritto in vetta
Zitto merda, in zona √® un labirinto e non ci ho visto scelta
Non mi lamento, ma capisco cosa mi sconcerta
E dal fondo dell'abisso comunque vi piscio in testa
Me ne fotto dei critici
Sai che sfondo i tuoi limiti
Tu fai il mostro ma levati, faccio il fosso a 'sti scemi
Io ti mozzo se m'imiti
Levo intorno i tuoi simili
In un pozzo di ebeti non dimostro gli schemi
Livello alto, io vi batto con 4 rimette (Goddamn!)
Non sei scaltro, sopra il palco ti intacco 'sti rapper (Goddamn!)
Metti in ballo ci√≤ che valgo, non parlo per niente (Goddamn!)
Per quel che ho fatto
Non mi calcolo manco 'sta gente (Goddamn!)
Voglio una corona come copricapo
Di livello sono fuori stato, fuori status
Della media che vi ho appena rovinato
Conosco i miei traguardi
Non mi serve mica esser nominato, ah
Mischio i flussi con le percussioni (Uh-uh)
Cos√¨ da non pensare alle delusioni
Smonto dei bulletti come dei bulloni
In Puglia di 'sta merda sto tra i precursori (Grr-pah)

Apro il telefono, ci sono due vie
Due file di barre scritte non avendo nient'altro
Vivo in freestyle e mi dico: ""Carpe diem""
Se posso spaccare il palco chiedo: ""Perch√© non farlo?""

Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Woah, woah, woah, woah, Waterloo, finally facing my Waterloo

My, my
I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
Oh yeah
And now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight

And how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to

When I was a little girl
I had a rag doll
Only doll I've ever owned
Now I love you just the way I loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown
And it gets stronger, in every way
And it gets deeper, let me say
And it gets higher, day by day

And do I love you my oh my
Yeah, river deep, mountain high
If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

When you were a young boy
Did you have a puppy
That always followed you around
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No I'll never let you down
'Cause it grows stronger, like a river flows
And it gets bigger baby, and heaven knows
And it gets sweeter baby, as it grows

And do I love you my oh my
Yeah, river deep, mountain high
If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby
If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

I love you baby like a flower loves the spring
And I love you baby just like Tina loves to sing
And I love you baby like a school boy loves his pet
And I love you baby, river deep, mountain high
Oh yeah you've gotta believe me
River deep, mountain high
Do I love you my oh my, oh baby

If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby"

You've got all that is really needed
To save a dying world from its funklessness

Stupidly I forced a smile
My composure was secure
I wore a silly grin from ear to ear
A smile they saw right through
Oh, but then like a streak of lightning it came
Filling my brain with this pain
Without saying a word this voice I heard
""Give up the funk, you punk""

Unfunky kind of UFO
(From the sun)
Here from the sun
(You've got the groove)
You've got the groove and we want some

We're unfunky and we're obsolete

And we're out of time
Gonna take your funk and make it mine
(""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh"")

You could feel so much better
If you would show me how to funk like you do

You've got all that is really needed
To save a dying world from its funklessness

Deep in pain I called the names
Of some funkified friends of mine
And they were on the road and gettin' it on
And groovin' for hours live
Oh, like a streak of lightning it came
Filling my brain with pain

Right before my eyes and they were saying

I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile
My curiosity runnin' wild
Cruisin' and playin' the radio
With no particular place to go

Ridin' along in my automobile
I's anxious to tell her the way I feel
So I told her softly and sincere
And she leaned and whispered in my ear
Cuddlin' more and drivin' slow
With no particular place to go


No particular place to go
So we parked way out on the kokomo
The night was young and the moon was bold
So we both decided to take a stroll
Can you imagine the way I felt?
I couldn't unfasten her safety belt

Ridin' along in my calaboose
Still tryin' to get her belt aloose
All the way home I held a grudge
For the safety belt that wouldn't budge
Cruisin' and playin' the radio
With no particular place to go"

Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

""You the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me""

Rock, rock, rock


Sad Sack was sitting on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said, ""Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
You can't find a partner, use a wooden chair""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock

And all my so called treasures
Made a strainer of my arms

Clippity clopping over hill and plain
Seems as how they'll never stop
Clippity clop, clippity clop
Clippity, clippity, clippity, clippity
Clippity clopping along

There's a plug of chaw tobaccy for a rancher in Corona
A guitar for a cowboy way out in Arizona
A dress of calico for a pretty Navajo
Get along mule, get along

Mule train, (*hyah, hyah*), mule train
Clippity clopping over mile and chain
Soon their gonna reach the top
Clippity clop, clippity clop
Clippity, clippity, clippity, clippity
Clippity clopping along

There's some cotton thread and needle
For the folks who's way out yonder
A shovel for a miner who left his home to wander
Some rheumatism pills for the settlers in the hills
Get along mule, get along

Mule train, (*hyah, hyah*), mule train
Clippity clopping through the rain
They'll keep goin' to the top
Clippity clop, clippity clop
Clippity, clippity, clippity, clippity
Clippity clopping along

There's a letter full of sadness and it's black around the border
A pair of boots for someone who had them made to order
A bible in the pack for the Reverend Mr. Black
Get along mule, get along

Get along mule, get along

Do me baby, like you wanna
Do me baby, if you gonna
Love me boy, any way you can
Do me, like a nasty man

This ain't nothin but another thing
Oh what you got boy, let me show you what it's gonna bring

Pop that bag, don't turn me loose
Don't stop now, 'cause it ain't no use
The job you doin' is from 9 to 5
Ain't got no time to shuck and jive
All is well baby, ain't nothin' wrong
If you like what you doin', boy you got to pay the cost

Every man sure oughta be like you
Ain't no doubt about what you can do
What you got now is hard to find
And I'm so glad that I can say you're mine"

So ya wanna dump out yo' trick bag
Ease on in a hip thang
But you ain't exactly sure what is hip
So you started to let your hair grow
Spent big bucks on your wardrobe
Somehow, ya know there's much more to the trip

You're into a hip trip
Maybe hipper than hip
What is hip?

You became a part of a new breed
Been smokin' only the best weed
Hangin' out with the so called ""Hippie set.""
Seen in all the right places
Seen with just the right faces
You should be satisfied, but still it ain't quite right

Tell me, tell me, if you think you know

If you're really hip
The question, ""Will it show?""
You're into a hip trip
Maybe hipper than hip

Come on

Hipness is. What it is
Hipness is. What it is
Hipness is. What it is
Sometimes hipness is, what it ain't

You went an' found you a guru
In an effort to find you a new you
And maybe even raise your conscious level
While you're striving to find the right road
There's one thing you should know
What's hip today, might become pass√©

As hard as we can
We don't want no sympathy

Put out every fire, and block up every flood

I don't want nobody to give me nothing
Open up the door, I'll get it myself
I don't want nobody to give me nothing

I'm not gonna tell you what to do
I'm not gonna raise a fuss
But before you make another rule
Let's start by taking care of us

I don't want nobody to give me nothing
Open up the door, huh, I'll get it myself
Do you hear me?
I don't want nobody to give me nothing
Open up the door, huh, I'll get it myself

Kids, get that education
And don't you take no bar
Cause we're gonna get this thing together
And you got to get them all

Open up the door, open up the door
Open up the door, open up the door

Everything is good and brown
I'm here again
With a sunshine smile upon my face
My friends are close at hand
And all my inhibitions have disappeared without a trace
I'm glad, oh, that I found ooh
Somebody who I can rely on

This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say, at the speed of cheeba, you and I go deeper
Maybe I'm gonna have to get high just to get by

You know I got that
I got that cheeba, cheeba kinda space cowboy vibe
Ah-ha ah yeah-ah

Everything is good, oh, and green
Say, I'm red again
And I don't suppose I'm coming down
I can see clearly, so high in sky
A man with psychedelic picture frames
Of happiness to shade his eyes
He's glad, oh, that I found
Somebody who he can rely on

This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say, at the speed of cheeba, and we‚Äôll go deeper

Write it down, you better wait for a while
So take your hands out of your pockets
Get your face adjusted, I heard it, somebody lied

Gonna let this thing continue, in its natural time

Got shocked once, got shocked twice

I got a rock in my throat, upside, upside down
My tummy start to talk, what it say?
Gonna rock it 'til I shock it
Gonna kick it 'til I drop it
Woo, love at first sight
You can kick it, you can poke it, ooh
I think you broke it, what about that?
Skin from a snake, blood from a stone
You know, that ain't no lie
I got hundreds of expressions
Try to make a good impression
Woo, right between the eye
I don't mind, let me go
, I don't know
Let me be, why not stay?
I feel numb, let me play
I got a wild imagination
Talkin' transubstantiation
Any version will do
I got mass communication
I'm the human corporation
I ate a rock from the moon

You might laugh but not for long

Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell
Go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by, they would stop and say
""Oh, my, but that little country boy could play""
Go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Johnny B. Goode


His mother told him, ""Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Sayin' 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'""

Go, go
Go, Johnny, go
Go, go, go, Johnny, go

You were so quiet there by yourself
Things were fine 'til they took you down
And opened you up and passed you around
John was the first one to pull you down
He took one drink and he started to clown
Passed you to Hazel, Jane, and Jack
Penelope got you and passed you right back
The doorbell rang and what did you see?
In walked Henry, Fred, and Marie
They hit you high, they hit you low
They hit you fast and they hit you slow
Whiskey on the shelf
You were so quiet there by yourself
Things were fine 'til they took you down
Opened you up and passed you around

Killed you dead and wanted another
They reached on the shelf and grabbed your brother
It's a shame the way they did you in
Then reached up and got your brother Gin

Grandfather Wine began to tremble with fright
Wondered if the party was going to last all night
Grandfather Wine knew without a doubt
He was next in line if the juice ran out
Whiskey on the shelf
You were so quiet there by yourself
Things were fine 'til they took you down
Opened you up and passed you around

Now look at everybody, they've got real tight
Now they want to start a fight
John never did nothin' wrong in his life
Now he's in a corner with the policeman's wife
Frank's so drunk he can hardly see
Trying to make love to Penelope
She took a bottle and hit him in the jaw
That's when the neighbors called the law
Whiskey on the shelf
You were so quiet there by yourself
Things were fine 'til they took you down
Opened you up and passed you around"

Hee-hee-hee-hee

My baby's always dancin' and it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no lovin' and that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco at every kinda disco
From that night, I kissed our love goodbye

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow, it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely, I've seen the lightning leave me
And my baby just can't take her eyes off me

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie (Woo!)
Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't, I just can't (Yeah)
I just can't (Woo!) control my feet
I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't, I just can't

Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't, on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

This magic music grooves me, that dirty rhythm fools me
The devil's gotten to me through this dance
I'm full of funky fever, a fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a super trance

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't you blame it, sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times

The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there, they began to wail
The band was jumping, and the joint began to swing
You shoulda heard those locked-out jailbirds sing

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Number forty-seven said to number three
""You the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Rock, rock, rock


Sad Sack was sitting on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said, ""Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
You can't find a partner, use a wooden chair""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Shifty Henry said to Bugs, ""For Heaven's sake
No one's looking, now's our chance to make a break""
Bugsy turned to Shifty, and he said, ""Nix nix
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks.""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block

So wave yo' hands in the air

Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump

I was asked in New York City: Do you like my clothes?
I'm talking to my tape recorder, walking down the road
But on Friday night, I'm, purified that my feet don't touch the floor
When the rubber meets the road, in between my toes

Everyday is fucking perfect, it's a paradise
Watch my life like it's a movie, have to watch it twice
A boy looks at a girl, and a girl looks like a pony
She gallops all day long, in between my toes
And every night, she's purified, she don't do that dance no more
When the rubber meets the road, in between my toes

I'm skankin on the dance floor, I'm drunk off that hennessey
I ain't sober, I don't mix with Coca-Cola or soda
But right now I'm on a roller, I take a look over my shoulder
When I see that sexy thing, I think it's time to work my way over
So I shuffle on my heals, and bounce on my toes
I'm crazy, and she knows, still it's all good I suppose
She picked a good place and she packed it up
I got behind her and I lapped it up
And we danced all night til the sun came up
Then I took her to my yard then I racked it up

I'm a member of the ju ju nation
Down in New Orleans
You don't need an application
If you move your feet

Explode if you poke it
Exposed on the floor
It grows if you soak it
It rolls out the door
Now

Summer time, every night, now my feet don't touch the floor
She don't do that dance no more, in between my toes
Him and you, you and I, I don't do that dance no more
When the rubber meets the road, in between my toes

The lady starts to sing, but she ain't no disco dancer
She learned to shake her thing, in between my toes

Explode if you poke it
Exposed on the floor
It grows if you soak it
It rolls out the door

Explode if you poke it
Exposed on the floor
It grows if you soak it
It rolls out the door"

Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mambo Number 5

One, two, three, four, five
Everybody in the car, so come on, let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna beer-bust, like I had last week
I must stay deep, 'cause talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue, you know they gettin' sweeter
So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me, flirtin' is just like a sport
Anything fly, it's all good, let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ha)

Mambo Number 5 (Ha)

Jump up and down and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound, put your hands on the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this, then you're doin' it right

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ha)

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ooh)

Fall in love with a girl like you
'Cause you can't run and you can't hide
You and me gonna touch the sky

There were hints and allegations

Maybe it's his first time around
Doesn't speak the language

And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't wanna know, forget her

Spread the word around
Guess who's back in town
You spread the word around

Friday night, they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's bar and grill
The drink will flow and blood will spill
And if the boys wanna fight, you better let 'em
That jukebox in the corner blastin' out my favourite song
The nights are gettin' warmer, it won't be long
Won't be long till summer comes
Now that the boys are here again

The boys are back in town

Here's my struttin', do-do-do
Struttin' my way on over to you
You like my strut? I like yours too
Struttin' my way on over to you
Seems like these days I got nothing to do
Hit the sidewalk and strut with you
Struttin' in the morning, struttin' at noon
Struttin' in the nighttime under the moon
Hey you, I like you too
And do you mind if I strut for you?
Baby, feel free to strut for me
You got a strut everybody should see
Watch that thing go side to side
Strut so hard with your struttin' thighs
Strut your way into my mind, I'm a fool
'Cause you're struttin' so fine
How about a little strut, it don't cost a dollar
Take my dog, don't forget the collar
But I'm the dog and I like your smell, can't help
That you strut so well
And baby, you got a head start
Struttin' your way into my heart
Take your hat off, make yourself at home
How about stay the night, and strut on home

Day one, I'm in love with your strut
Day two, I'm in love with your strut
Day three, I'm in love with your strut
Guess what? I'm in love with your strut
Day one, I'm in love with your strut
Day two, I'm in love with your strut
Day three, I'm in love with your strut
Guess what? I'm in love with your strut

I like your strut, do you wanna go struttin', struttin'?
You like my strut, then let's go struttin'
I like your strut, do you wanna go struttin', struttin'?
You like my strut, then let's go struttin' right now

A question for you: Wanna strut with me?
Think I make you smile as far as I can see
You make me laugh, think that I love you
How 'bout dinner 8:30 and a strut for two?
The way you strut like no one else
You got a thing all by yourself
If people can't hang, you can give them hell
You strut, clap clap, like you're ringing a bell
Don't need to go fast when you're struttin' with me
I got all night, got nowhere to be
I'm pretty fine just walkin' with you
Hold your hand while you whistle that tune
Tell you what, if you like my strut
I'll walk on ahead and you can look at my butt
Objectify, but don't cross the line
But you can be bad when it's struttin' time
'Cause you strut that thing just like a cock
Show them kids up and down the block
Flash your feathers and walk on by
You strut so good, you make Jimmy cry
Can't believe that you're struttin' with me
Let's strut somewhere everybody can see
And next to you, filled up with pride
We go boom, boom, side to side

Day one, I'm in love with your strut
Day two, I'm in love with your strut
Day three, I'm in love with your strut
Guess what? I'm in love with your strut

Now whip it into shape, shape it up, get straight
Go forward, move ahead, try to detect it, it's not too late
To whip it, whip it good

When a good time turns around, you must whip it
You will never live it down unless you whip it
No one gets away until they whip it

To hug and kiss you?

To give you happiness
And I drown, baby, drown, baby
In your arms, come on, baby

Turn like a wheel

He's alright
See for yourself

We're gonna move
Right now
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel
I remember when
Sittin' in the tub
Pulled out the plug
The water was runnin' out
Cool down
Stop acting crazy
They're gonna leave
And we'll be on our own
Seven times five
They were living creatures
Watch 'em come to life
Right before your eyes
Backsliding!
How do you do?

Gonna see you through"

Show me how to do like you
If you say please
Please

Since age one Keita knew he had the answer
And it was that someday he'd be a dancer
And with help from his sis
Surely that boy would not miss
From being the baddest dancer in the whole neighborhood
Late at night when he was supposed to be sleeping
You could hear the pitter patter of feet creeping
To where music would play
To his sister he would say
Before his father said, ""Hey boy, get right back in that bed""

Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it, oh oh
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you, hey

Once at school they put on a talent contest
To find out who could really boogie the best
But his mama said, no
""Keita's much too young to go""
But his sister said, ""Please let him go so the world can see""
When they saw him they said, ""He must be crazy
Look at him, he ain't nothing but a baby""
But soon as he began
You knew the contest he would win
Because everyone in the audience began to cheer

Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it, oh oh oh oh
Show me how to do like you

Uptown got its hustlers
The Bowery got its bums
42nd Street got Big Jim Walker
He a pool-shootin' son of a gun
Yeah, he big and dumb as a man can come
But he stronger than a country hoss
And when the bad folks all get together at night
You know they all call Big Jim ""Boss"", just because
And they say

""You don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger
And you don't mess around with Jim""

Well outta south Alabama come a country boy
He said, ""I'm lookin' for a man named Jim
I am a pool-shootin' boy, my name's Willie McCoy
But down at home they call me Slim
Yeah I'm lookin' for the king of 42nd Street
He drivin' a drop top Cadillac
Last week he took all my money, and it may sound funny
But I come to get my money back""
And everybody say, ""Jack don't you

You don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger
And you don't mess around with Jim""
Well, a hush fell over the pool room
Jimmy come boppin' in off the street
And when the cuttin' was done
The only part that wasn't bloody
Was the soles of the big man's feet, ooh
And he was cut in about a hundred places
And he was shot in a couple more
And you better believe
They sung a different kind of story
When Big Jim hit the floor, ooh now they say

""You don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger
And you don't mess around with Slim""

Yeah, Big Jim got his hat
Find out where it's at
And it's not hustlin' people strange to you
Even if you do got a two-piece custom-made pool cue

Yeah you don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger
And you don't mess around with Slim"

Listen to me

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody wants somebody to love

When the sun goes down (you, you, you, you)
Ain't no nobody around you (you, you, you, you)

Sometimes I feel like
I feel a little sad inside
My baby mistreats me
And I can't get a little, little mad

But I need you (you, you, you)
Just to see me through, sugar (you, you, you, you)

When I feel a little lonely
But I wanna hear you say yeah
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah

I want someone to be a witness tonight
And I just wanna hear you say, ""I love you""

Ooh, this old heart of mine been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow
Bringing you back again, hurting me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing if I'm coming or going

But I, I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes, I do
(Yes, I do, yes, I do)

These old arms of mine miss having you around
Makes these tears inside start pouring down

Always with half a kiss, you remind me of what I miss
Though I try to control myself
Like a fool I start grinnin'
'Cause my head starts spinnin'

'Cause I, I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes I do, yes I do

Ooh, I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'
The way you treat me leaves me incomplete
You're here for the day, gone for the week now

But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it
Tell the world about it

'Cause I, I love you

It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like tryin' tell a stranger 'bout-a rock 'n' roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tappin', and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind


If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until mornin', 'til there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancin', baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

I need love, love
To ease my mind
I need to find, find
Someone to call mine
But Mama said

""You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait""
She said, ""Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"" (Can't wait)
""You can't hurry love (Ooh, until that day)
No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time (Love don't come easy)
No matter how long it takes""

But how many heartaches
Must I stand
Before I find a love
To let me live again?
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Yeah, is almost gone
I remember Mama said

""(You can't hurry love)
No, you just have to wait""
She said, ""Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"" (Can't wait)
How long must I wait? (Ooh, until that day)
How much more can I take
Before loneliness (Love don't come easy)
Will cause my heart, heart to break?

No I can't bear
To live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love
To call my own
But when I feel that I
I can't go on
These precious words
Keeps me hangin' on
I remember Mama said

""(You can't hurry love)
No, you just have to wait""
She said, ""Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"" (Can't wait)
""You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait"" (Ooh, until that day)
She said, ""Trust, give it time (Love don't come easy)
No matter how long it takes""
(Now break!)

No, love, love
Don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating
For that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight

I keep waiting (Can't wait, ooh, until that day)
I keep on waiting
But it ain't easy (Love don't come easy)
It ain't easy, but Mama said
""You can't hurry love (Ooh, until that day)
No, you just have to wait""
She said, ""Trust, give it time (Love don't come easy)

(Brian, you're so crazy for this)

I'm a gangster, we can shoot or we can fight
Your bitch tryna fuck, I'm like, ""Alright, but you can't spend the night""
I like when bad hoes get on top and ride me a bike
I'm from the ghetto where lame niggas be dyin' every night (Ayy)
Man, if she bad, when I see her, I'ma say somethin' to her
I got two hoes with me now, and I'm the man in the middle
We catch an opp and he on camera, still gon' send him to the 'spital
Don't play with me, I'll beat your ass like an instrumental

I got some mon–µy in my pocket, this shit fallin' out
Big bully inside the hood, Deebo, stall him out
H–µllcat, this bitch too fast, this bitch stallin' out
Man, you was blowin' up her phone, I had balls in her mouth
Rich nigga, I'd probably end up spendin' two-fifty with my bitch
I'm in the mall with my dog, hoes askin' ""That's for pics?""
I spent ten on the puppy, half of that for my 'fit
Gave her a hundred for some 'Woods, told that bitch to keep the rest
Niggas don't like me, probably hate to see me shinin' on they TV
Really poppin', still slidin', I'll probably put your block on repeat
Don't act sleep, niggas put they head down when they see me
I'll beat your ass up and hit you with a three-piece

I'm a gangster, we can shoot or we can fight
Your bitch tryna fuck, I'm like, ""Alright, but you can't spend the night""

Don't play with me, I'll beat your ass like an instrumental

Man, if she bad, when I see her, I'ma say somethin' to her, like
""Who you is? What you doin'? Where you goin'?""
I don't gotta say who I am, these hoes know me, I got motion
Playin' with me, I'll hit you with that blick, I ain't your brodie
I'll run off on a nigga, he get mad, we gon' step on him
I hope them niggas die like dog, they got death on 'em
I got fifty thousand in guns, we got real money
Nigga, not no deal money, I put it up, don't spend a pill money
Way deep inside the club and I'm with five niggas
Probably five killers
Slidin' with that cutter, let's change the ride, nigga
I run into the opps, they better hope that God with 'em
 pop, we was poppin' niggas up when we was robbin' niggas

I'm a gangster, we can shoot or we can fight

Oh, what a night
Late December, back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember, what a night

Oh, what a night
You know, I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I, I got a funny feeling
When she walked in the room
And my, as I recall
It ended much too soon

(Oh, what a night)
Hypnotizing, mesmerizin' me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

And I felt a rush
Like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around
And takin' my body under
(Oh, what a night)

Oh, I got a funny feeling
When she walked in the room
And my, as I recall
It ended much too soon

(Oh, what a night)
Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I felt a rush
Like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around
And takin' my body under

Trying to get your head around

See how I'm tripping out

Cranking up your altercations, getting upset in your desperation
Screamin' and hollerin'
How could this love become so paper-thin?
You're playing so hard to get
You're making me sweat just to hold your attention
I can't give you nothing more
If you ain't giving nothing to me
Don't you know that

You make me love you, love you baby

Why does it have to be like this?

Seems like you're stepping on the pieces
Of my broken shell
'Cause you make me love, love you

The twenty-first night of September?

In the key that our souls were singin'

Holdin' hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love, remember
How we knew love was here to stay
Now December
Found a love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love, remember
True love we share today

There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes, a flaming glow
Most people look at him with terror and with f–µar
But to Moscow chicks, he was such a lovely dear
H–µ could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar
But the kazachok, he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state, he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen, he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger for power
Became known to more and more people
The demands to do something about this outrageous man
Became louder and louder

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

""This man's just got to go,"" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged, ""Don't you try to do it, please""
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute, they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
""Come to visit us,"" they kept demanding
And he really came

Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and he said, ""I feel fine""
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him 'til he was dead

Oh, those Russians"

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game

Stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Tsar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
Oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Aww yeah

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, ""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When, after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

I've got some good old loving
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwing it on you
You got to come back for more
Girls and things will come by the dozen
But that ain't nothing
But ten cent loving
Pretty little thing
Let me light your candle
Cause, baby, I'm sure hard to handle now
Yes, I am
Hey, give it to me
I got to have it
Good old loving

Hey, said give it to me

Good old loving

Get off

Pretty ladies are at our discretion
So we can get off
We keep under the sheets with two lovelies
So we can get off
Sly look that we keep the promise, ladies
And make me get off
Take it from girls with our imagination
So we can get off

Call me up at your place, I can love you crazy
In the heat you will understand
Danger and excitement, that's what makes a lady
Find out what she wants in a man

To get off, to get off, to get off, to get off
To get off, to get off, to get off, to get, get off
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Lookin' through that dress that drive me crazy and makes me get off
Sensuality excites my mind, it makes get off
If I were you I'd get a good perspective on how to get off
Love me wild and love me crazy, so we can get off

Call me up at your place, I can love you crazy
In the heat you will understand
Danger and excitement, that's what makes a lady
Find out what she wants in a man

Well, when I was a young man and never been kissed
I got to thinkin' it over, how much I had missed
So I got me a girl and I kissed her and then, and then
Oh Lordy, well I kissed her again

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had, mm-mmm, kisses sweeter than wine
(Sweeter than wine)

Well, I asked her to marry and be my sweet wife
I told her we'd be so happy for the rest of our life
I begged her and I pleaded like a natural man
And then, whoops oh Lordy, well she gave me her hand

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had, mm-mmm, kisses sweeter than wine
(Sweeter than wine)

Well, we worked very hard, both me and my wife
Workin' hand-in-hand to have a good life
We had corn in the field and wheat in the bin
And then, whoops oh Lord, I was the father of twins

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had, mm-mmm, kisses sweeter than wine
(Sweeter than wine)

Well, our children, they numbered just about four
And they all had a sweetheart a-knockin' at the door
They all got married and they wouldn't hesitate
I was, whoops oh Lord, the grandfather of eight

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had, mm-mmm, kisses sweeter than wine
(Sweeter than wine)

Well, now that I'm old and I'm ready to go
I get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago
Had a lotta kids, a lotta trouble and pain
But then, whoops oh Lordy, well I'd do it all again

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine

Gettin' old, gettin' grey
Gettin' ripped off, underpaid
Gettin' sold, second-hand
That's how it goes, playin' in a band

It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
If you wanna be a star of stage and screen
Look out, it's rough and mean
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll

Well, it's a long way

Yeah, here comes Amos

Now Amos Moses was a Cajun
He lived by his self in the swamp
He hunted alligator for livin'
He just knock 'em in the head with a stump
The Louisiana law gonna get you Amos!
It ain't legal huntin' alligator down in the swamp boy!

Now everybody blamed his old man
For makin' him mean as a snake
When Amos Moses was a boy
His Daddy would use him for alligator bait
Tie a rope around his waist and throw him in the swamp
Alligator bait in the Louisiana Bayou

About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a man called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well, they raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groceries
They named him after a man of the cloth, called him Amos Moses

Now all the folks around south Louisiana
Said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest, the meanest alligator
And just use one hand
That's all he got left cuz alligator bit it!
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow!

Well the Sheriff got wind that Amos
Was in the swamp tracking alligator skin
So he snuck in the swamp, gonna get the boy
But he never come out again
Well I wonder where the Louisiana Sheriff went to?
Well you can sure get lost in the Louisiana Bayou!

About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a cat called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well, they raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groceries
They named him after a man of the cloth, called him Amos Moses

Set out on 'em Amos
Make it count, Son!
About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a man called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hanna..."

My heart gives a chil
I feel such a thrill
My feet won't keep still
When they swing that music
Rythm like that puts me in a trance
Oh you can't blame me for wanting to dance
From what I understand
It must be just grand
To play in a band
When they swing that music
Oh I'm as happy as can be
When they swing that music for me
With my eyes I can see
All of the glee
The bees in the knees
When they swing that music
Rythm like that don't do nothing but make me smile
Oh you can't blame me if I'm gone for a while
From what has been said
I'm getting ahead
I'll swing you to bed
Once they've swung that music
Oh I'm as happy as can be
When you swing that music with me

My head feels a buzz
A reason there was
I feel buzz because
They're swinging that music
Rythm like that sends me up the wall
Oh you can't blame me if I don't wanna fall
From what I have heard
It must mean the world
To dance with that girl
When they swing that music
Oh I'm happy as can be
When you swing that music with me"

All aboard, hahahahahaha
Ayy

Crazy, but that's how it goes
Millions of people living as foes
Maybe it's not too late
To learn how to love and forget how to hate

Mental wounds not healing
Life's a bitter shame

I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
(Let's go)

I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools
I've watched all the dropouts, who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role

Mental wounds still screaming
Driving me insane

I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words, yeah, yeah

Heirs of a cold war, that's what we've become
Inheriting troubles, I'm mentally numb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something that just isn't fair

Mental wounds not healing
Who and what's to blame?

I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

One day it's feathers and the next day chicken while I'm pickin' my yakety axe

Livin' on a shoestring, puttin' off things like a shave and a haircut
Money don't matter as long as I scatter a little bit of happiness around
If people keep a grinnin' I figure I'm a winnin' my good old yakety sound
City folks go around turnin' up their noses and countin' their greenbacks and smellin' their roses
But I wouldn't trade my yakety axe, even for a T-bone
I'm confessin' I never took a lesson, all my notes are a matter of guessin'
Hopin' they'll come out in some kinda manner that'll make the yakety sound
So if you're in the mood and your feet start tappin'
And you feel laid back and your hands start clappin'
Then I'll have done what I wanted to from way back
You're diggin' my yakety axe"

Your everlasting summer
And you can see it fading fast
So you grab a piece of something
That you think is gonna last
Well, you wouldn't even know a diamond
If you held it in your hand
The things you think are precious
I can't understand

Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?

You been tellin' me you're a genius
Since you were seventeen
In all the time I've known you
I still don't know what you mean
The weekend at the college
Didn't turn out like you planned
The things that pass for knowledge
I can't understand

Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?


I spend a lot of money
And I spent a lot of time
The trip we made to Hollywood
Is etched upon my mind
After all the things we've done and seen
You find another man
The things you think are useless
I can't understand

Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years?

Just about the break of day

She came and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair

(She came) Blood in the streets, run a river of sadness
(She came) Blood in the streets, it's up to my thigh
(She came) Yeah, the river runs red down the legs of the city
(She came) The women are crying red rivers of weepin'

She came in town and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair


Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind

Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of fantastic LA

Blood screams her brain, they chop off her fingers
Blood will be born in the birth of a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union

There's blood in the streets, it's up to my ankles
Blood in the streets, it's up to my knee

I was walkin' down the street
Concentrating on truckin' right
I heard a dark voice beside of me
And I looked round in a state of fright
I saw four faces, one mad
A brother from the gutter
They looked me up and down a bit
And turned to each other

I say
I don't like cricket, oh no
I love it
I don't like cricket, no no
I love it
Don't you walk through my words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk through my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet
Well he looked down at my silver chain
He said I'll give you one dollar
I said you've got to be joking man
It was a present from me mother
He said I like it I want it
I'll take it off your hands
And you'll be sorry you crossed me
You'd better understand that you're alone
A long way from home

And I say
I don't like reggae, no no
I love it, yeah
I don't like reggae, no, no
I love it, yeah
Don't you cramp me style Don't you queer me pitch
Don't you walk through my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet

I hurried back to the swimming pool
Sinkin' pi√±a colada
I heard a dark voice beside me say
Would you like something harder?
She said I've got it, you want it
My harvest is the best
And if you try it, you'll like it
And wallow in a dreadlock holiday
(Dreadlock holiday, dreadlock holiday
Dreadlock holiday, dreadlock holiday)

And I say
Don't like Jamaica, oh no
I love her
Don't like Jamaica, oh no
I love her (Oh yeah)
Don't you walk through her words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk through her words

So you're blue, but I can't take a chance on a chick like you

Ah, but girl, you're only a child

Well I can dance with you, honey

Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

Take it easy, take it easy
Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy, take it easy
Try to cool it, girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?

I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
Now you're so cute, I like your style
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile
Smile, but girl, you're only a child

There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
Say it might have been a fiddle or it could have been the wind
But there seems to be a beat now I can feel it my feet now
Listen here it comes again!
There's a band out on the highway
They're high stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands
Sun went down in honey
And the moon came up in wine
You know stars were spinning dizzy, Lord
The band kept us too busy we forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music played the band, Lord
They're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight
Balls of lighting roll along
Old men sing about their dreams
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playing on
Keep on dancing thru the daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No ones's noticed, but the band's all pack and gone
Was it ever there at all?
But they kept on dancing
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands
Well the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped"

Warden threw a party in the county jail
Prison band was there and they began to wail
The joint was jumping and the band began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody on the whole cell block
They was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody on the whole cell block
They was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Well, number forty-seven said to number three
""You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the jailhouse rock with me""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody on the whole cell block
They was dancing to the jailhouse rock
Let's rock

The sad sack was a sitting on a block of stone
Way over in the corner, weeping all alone
The warden said, ""Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
If you can't find a partner, use a wooden chair""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock

All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind

Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green
Pretty music, I hear, so happy and loud
Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
If you tried to ask, ""Or is it cool?"" (Is it cool?)
If you arrive and don't see me
I'm gonna be with my baby
I'm free, flyin' in her arms

See speakers of kites
With velvet roses digging freedom flight

To the crazy little demon that the woman still the boss
Down in the valley on the foggy hill rock
You can still hear the demon blowing his top

Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance, and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people, go

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget, no
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all, Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

Can't you feel it all over?

Candy on the beach, there's nothing better
But I like Candy when it's wrapped in a sweater
Some day soon, I'll make her mine
Then I'll have Candy all the time

I want Candy

Took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
Stuck a lovin' 44 beneath my head
Woke up next morning grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
I made a good run but I went too slow
They over took me down in Juarez, Mexico
Sittin in the hop joint smoking my fill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said ""Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown'
Why you're the dirty hog that shot your woman down
Yes, oh yes my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
Shot her cold how she made me sore
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more
Put me on the train I was dressed in black
Lost the sheriff man it brought me back
Had no one to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail
And next morning along about nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
And he coughed as he cleared his throat
Come on you dirty hop into the district court

Into the court room the trial began
Where I was paneled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw the little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I thought, ""Oh lordy lordy have mercy on me""
The judge smiled as he picked u his pen
Ninety-nine years in that old San Quentin pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I'll never forget the day I shot my woman down
Come on you hops and listen up to me
Just lay off your whiskey and let that cocaine be"

And when I fight, you'd better run
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I'm goin' down in a middle of town
I'm goin' to shoot the first man down
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
My skin is hot as leather I'm as tough as any man
When I have to shave myself, I use an old tin can
I wash my face in boilin' wax and scrub myself with gunny sacks
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I'm mean - I'm mean - I'm mean
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I was raised on tiger's milk
I drink corn liquor and I smoke corn silk
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I chew up tin and I spit out nails
Sleep on snakes with ten-foot tails
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I started feelin' frisky
And I danced the other night
I fell so good, I took my gun and shot out ev'ry light

Now the Sheriff said, get out off town
Take him six feet under ground
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I'm mean - I'm mean - I'm mean
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I throwed my saddle on a grizzly bear
Then I crawled bare-handed in his mountain lair
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I cut my hair on a choppin' block
And when I chopped, the mountains rocked
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun
I tangled with a wild cat, just to proof that I was stout
Reached down his throat and grabbed his tail, then turned him inside out
Where I was raised, it's so darn tough
I had to leave, it got so rough
I'm a mean, mean, mean son of a gun"

It's astounding
Time is fleeting
Madness takes its toll
But listen closely
Not for very much longer
I've got to keep control
I remember doing the Time Warp
Drinking those moments when
The blackness would hit me
And the void would be calling

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

It's just a jump to the left
And then a step to the right
With your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

It's so dreamy
Oh, fantasy free me
So you can't see me
No, not at all
In another dimension
With voyeuristic intention
Well secluded, I see all
With a bit of a mind flip
You're into the time slip
And nothing can ever be the same
You're spaced out on sensation
Like you're under sedation

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

Well I was walking down the street
Just-a having a think
When a snake of a guy gave me an evil wink
He shook-a me up, he took me by surprise
He had a pick up truck and the devil's eyes
He stared at me and I felt a change
Time meant nothing, never would again

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

It's just a jump to the left
And then a step to the right
With your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust

Slow your horse we winning thise race

And I create these masterpieces just to bury these lames
Villains go fucking insane,rebel doggs marking your names
Kay naas deep ug wa sa mid ang real  nga nasty sa game
Okay i said that,bitch you know i meant that
Insted of minding your fucking biz
You've reached a death trap
Call this one a death rap,one you can't escape bruh
Tight as fuck,we solid as hell

Gatubod na akong bara kinaganglan na e spit
Hinganli ang gustong e diss murag sa NBI ma hit
Way agian nga pag antos kuna ako na ang mu slit
Naka clienttrace ang sigth kada buto one hit delete
Iladong matador ko kung sa mic makagunit
Ug madugay kos duwa diba mahawan nig kalit
Ang eksena nga puno sa mga trying hard na shit
Mga bulala rang dako pero sa rap game dili fit

We be on point with the joints, 'cause we ain't taking no fall
So I'ma go for mine (So son, go for yours)
Yo, I'ma go for mine (So son, go for yours)

My crew be in the mix, like name brand kicks
The kids that only deal with that type of nonsense
You can't get wit, D.K.S. self evident
Adolescence, reign the supreme court, in any, every, meant

The time was approximately eleven forty three
When the D called me, and told me, we must be
Lyrically, the best that he says, the
K N O C K, and S and K, it's spray
Comin' away, the B.T.J., it be they
I'ma hold it down, with sounds
Like clowns, walk the trey pound
Now in the underground, B.T.J. just entered
Remember, the S comes last like December
Once shit cock it's time to Rock like the Monsta
In reality, B.T.J., is lyrically responsible for all difficulties

My lyrics oppose a threat to the best M.C. yet
And appears nightmares for those who slept
Also the biters, claimin they writers
They need to think about what they talk about
When you exposin' your dirt, that's when you dummin' out
Dwellin' in the PJ's, all day, hangin' out with nothin' to do
Them rebellin' niggas is mad, 'cause I'm tellin'' the truth
Hittin' yo with mind craftin', flows to molecular cord graphin

So I'ma go for mine (So son, go for yours)

Aiyo one day it was me and the D
Walkin' down the street, some niggas stepped to me
Said are you Lil R-U-T-I-Z
He said I heard you nice on the muthafuckin' M-I-C
Battle me, battle right here, and let's see
So we kicked a verse that didn't hurt
So I hit 'em worst, to let him know I don't play those games
Save 'em for the jerks, D. Verbs said ""Son, let me get some""
I said ""No, 'cause he's a victim, and he probably in my premises
You know when I open my book with my lyrics I'm endin' this""
(No question) All this shit he poppin' in my ears
Fuckin' ejected, he can't hang with my style
Look now, here's man fillin' it, back to like what I was sayin
I start extortin', I'm not playin'
You want Lil Knock? I come on your block
Cock and then start sprayin', lyrics
So don't start what you can't finish
'Cause I will be sure to end whatever you created

Mentally you can't function
Physically you dead with the push of this button
Explosion be corruptin', from the expert of execution
I met Lil Knock at the junction
He was talkin' about walkin', to the tree spot
We took the L to New Rox, we got stopped by two cops
Talkin' about ""Where the two Glocks?"", we doo wops
How was I two Glocks? Man, it's too hot
And I'm cold, so let me go, I never hold
Whoever told you, that I do la?
Lil Sha, fuck a do or die
Nigga die, because of what they do
I do what I do with my crew
Po-po was hype, they was like ""You bite, stick with the mic device""
Drivin' off, said ""Have a good night""
Personally I might, and all that shit I said was a psych'

So who's the crew that give nightmares to those who slept (D.K.S.)
Constantly flown with finesse (D.K.S.)
Puttin' all comp' to rest (D.K.S.)
Be the best so you can't contest"

Well, here I am on record at last
And it feels so wonderful to be here with you on my first album

I don't worry, worrying don't agree

Things that bother you never bother me. I feel happy and fine, aha

Haven't got a lot, I don't need a lot. coffee's only a dime

At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey


It took all the strength I had, not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Well, now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, oh

Go on now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, I will survive"

I went and bought myself a ticket
And I sat down in the very first row
They pulled the curtain
But then when they turned the spotlight way down low
Little Egypt came out struttin'
Wearing nothin' but a button and a bow

Singing, ‚ÄúYing-yang, ying-yang
Ying-yang, ying-yang‚Äù

She had a ruby on her tummy
And a diamond big as Texas on her toe
She let her hair down
And she did the hoochie-coochie real slow
When she did her special number on the zebra skin
I thought she'd stop the show

Singing, ‚ÄúYing-yang, ying-yang
Ying-yang, ying-yang‚Äù

She did her triple somersault, and when she hit the ground
She winked at the audience, and then she turned around
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine
Said, Phoenix, Arizona 1949

Yeah, but let me tell you people
Little Egypt doesn't dance there anymore
She's too busy mopping
And a-takin' care of shopping at the store
'Cause we've got seven kids
And all day long they crawl around the floor

Heh
Singing, ‚ÄúYing-yang, ying-yang

You send me tumblin' down

Hey, y'all, Little Richard's in town

We got brother George here tonight from down in Mexico
He skated all the way up here just to see the beauty
We got everybody here tonight
We got black folk, we got white folk
We got red folk, we got brown folk
We got yellow folk, we got real folk
We got love folk
I want y'all to know that I'm here tonight
And I've been talkin' about love for a long time
Because, honey, I'm the man that started it all
The emancipator of soul and the king of rock and roll
From Macon, Georgia
I want you to know that I'm here to be offered tonight in the fullness
That the beauty is still on duty
Let it all hang out
With the beautiful Little Richard from down in Macon, Georgia
I want you all to know that I am the Georgia peach
Let all the women folk say wooh (wooh)
Let all the men say ugh (ugh)
Ooh, my soul

A man walked up to me yesterday and say
""Little Richard, don't you know that James Brown can beat you at dancin'?""
I said ""Beat me dancin'? I suppose you ever thought about that he don't look like me?""
Shut up, I'm the star, and don't you ever forget it
But I'm here tonight to let you know
That it's time for everybody to have a good time
Shut up

Make up their minds
To not believe nobody behind
But take all to everlasting happiness (joy)

A message of love and hope and peace
A message that every man, every woman, every boy, every girl need to hear

Now just because you're pretty
And you think you're mighty wise
You tell me that you love me
Then you roll those big brown eyes
When I saw you last week
Your eyes were turning black
Go find the guy that beats you up
Ask him to take you back

Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
I can tell you've been out on a spree
It's plain that you're lyin'
When you say that you've been cryin'
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me

Now I used to spend my money
To make you look real sweet
I wanted to be proud of you
When we walked down the street
Now don't ask me to dress you up
In satin and in silk
Your eyes look like two cherries
In a glass of buttermilk

Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
I can tell that you've been out on a spree
It's plain that you're lyin'
When you say that you've been cryin'
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me

Now I guess our little romance
Has finally simmered down
You should join a circus
You'd make a real good clown
Your eyes look like a roadmap
I'm scared to smell your breath
You'd better shut your peepers
Before you bleed to death

Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
I can tell you've been out on a spree
It's plain that you're lyin'
When you say that you've been cryin'
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me"

She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, tellin' me no lies
Knockin' me out with those American thighs
Takin' more than her share, had me fightin' for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shakin', the Earth was quakin'
My mind was achin', and we were makin' it

And you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you
Shook me all night long

Workin' double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine, all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shakin', the Earth was quakin'
My mind was achin', and we were makin' it

And you
Shook me all night long

Shook me all night long

Sailin' away on the crest of a wave
It's like magic
Oh, rollin' and ridin' and slippin' and slidin'
It's magic

And you, and your sweet desire
You took me, oh

It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose

(I'm takin' a dive)
(Dive)

Making believe this is what you conceived
From your worst day (I'm takin' a dive)
Oh, moving in line, then you look back in time
To the first day (I'm takin', I'm takin')

And you, and your sweet desire (Don't you do it, don't you do it)
You took me, oh
Higher and higher, baby

It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing

(I'm takin' a dive)
(On the slide)
(Hey!)

Takin' a dive 'cause you can't halt the slide
Floating downstream (I'm takin' a dive)
Oh, so let her go, don't start spoiling the show
It's a bad dream (I'm takin', I'm takin')

And you, and your sweet desire (Don't you do it, don't you do it)

Wake up, little Susie, wake up

We've both been sound asleep
Wake up, little Susie, and weep
The movie's over, it's four o'clock
And we're in trouble deep

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie

Well, what are we gonna tell your mama?
What are we gonna tell your pa?
What are we gonna tell all our friends
When they say, ""Ooh la la""

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie

Well, I told your mama that
You'd be in by ten
Well, Susie, baby
Looks like we goofed again

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
We gotta go home

Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up

The movie wasn't so hot
It didn't have much of a plot
We fell asleep, our goose is cooked
Our reputation is shot

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie

Well, what are we gonna tell your mama?

What are we gonna tell our friends
When they say, ""Ooh la la""

There'll be swinging swaying records playing

Just as long as you are there
So come on every guy grab a girl

A chance for folks to meet
There'll be laughing, singing and music swinging

And killed whatever hesitance she showed

Oh oh oh yeah
In the nappy dugout
Come play
In the nappy dugout
(spoken)
What you mean by a dugout?
Oh oh oh yeah
In the nappy dugout"

Sca-do-ba-da, eww
Sca-do-ba-da, eww
(Sca-do-ba-da) We were at a party (Eww)
(Sca-do-ba-da) His earlobe fell in the deep (Eww)
(Sca-do-ba-da) Someone reached in and grabbed it (Eww)
(Sca-do-ba-da) Was a rock lobster (Eww)

(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Rock lobster
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Rock lobster

Eww
Eww
We were at the beach (Eww)
Everybody had matching towels (Eww)
Somebody went under a dock (Eww)
And there they saw a rock (Eww)
It wasn't a rock (Eww)
Was a rock lobster (Eww)

(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Rock lobster
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Rock lobster

Rock lobster, rock lobster
Motion in the ocean (Ooh ah)
His air hose broke (Hoo ah)
Lots of trouble (Ooh ah)
Lots of bubble (Hoo ah)
He was in a jam (Ooh ah)
He's in a giant clam (Hoo ah)

Rock, rock, rock lobster
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Down, down
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Sca-do-ba-da, eww
Sca-do-ba-da, eww
(Sca-do-ba-da) Underneath the waves (Eww)
(Sca-do-ba-da) Mermaids waving (Eww)
(Sca-do-ba-da) Waving to mermen (Eww)
(Sca-do-ba-da) Waving sea fans (Eww)
(Sca-do-ba-da) Seahorses sailing (Eww)
(Sca-do-ba-da) Dolphins wailing (Eww)

(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Rock lobster
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Rock lobster

Rock lobster, rock lobster
Ooh ah, hoo ah
Red snappers snapping (Ooh ah)
Clamshells clapping (Hoo ah)
Mussels flexing (Ooh ah)
Flippers flipping (Hoo ah)

Rock, rock, rock lobster
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Down, down‚Ä¶
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Lobster, rock
Lobster, rock
Let's rock

Boys in bikinis
Girls in surfboards
Everybody's rocking
Everybody's fruging
Twisting around the fire, having fun
Baking potatoes, baking in the sun
Put on your nose guard
Put on the lifeguard
Pass the tanning butter
Here comes a stingray (Ooh-wah, ooh-wah)
There goes a manta ray (Ah, ah, ah)
In walked a jellyfish
There goes a dogfish
Chased by a catfish
In flew a sea robin (La)
Watch out for that piranha
There goes a narwhal
Here comes a bikini whale (Ah)

Rock lobster (Lobster, rock lobster)
Rock lobster (Lobster, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Rock lobster (Lobster, rock lobster)
Rock lobster (Lobster, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah"

Seek him here, seek him on the highway
Never knowing when he'll appear
All await, engine's ticking over
Hear the roar as they sense the fear
Wheels! A glint of steel and a flash of light
Screams! From a streak of fire as he strikes

Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather

Black as night, faster than a shadow
Crimson flare from a raging sun
An exhibition, sheer precision
Yet no one knows from where he comes
Fools! Self destruct cannot take that crown
Dreams! Crash one by one to the ground

Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather

There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried


There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried

Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather"
