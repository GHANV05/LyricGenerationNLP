Last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet

No way it was our last night I kissed your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talkin' 'bout life, goin' sip for sip
Yeah, you, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me

I know that last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)

No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your mama, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah, my, my friends say, ""Let her go""
Your friends say, ""What the hell?""
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else

Oh, baby, last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can't remember everything we said, but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)

I know you said this time you really weren't comin' back again
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)

We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasing' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights

Yeah, you used to talk about
Getting even further South
Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round
Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now
Maybe a baby or a couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house

But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out
Think she dodged a bullet
Of a good old boy like me
'Cause I still
Go drinkin', same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way anyway

But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever

She'll set the field on fire just cuttin' across a pasture
She'll have you fallin' for it all and then leave right after
And she got a cold heart but she got a warm smile
Cut from the same cloth, she kinda buck wild
Little bit angel, whole lotta outlaw
She's trouble but I'll tell you right now, y'all

Long live cowgirls
Never gonna settle on down girls
Leave you in a lonely ghost town world
Where the sun don't rise, rodeo for one night
Love you like a mustang
One hand on thеm giddy-up reins
Hole in your heart with somе good aim
On a goodbye ride but it's fine 'cause it's kinda my thing
Long live cowgirls
Yeah, long live cowgirls

I hate that I love the way them kisses taste like whiskey
How they wake up, take on off, and not even miss me
Leave this heart broken, holdin' that smokin' gun
I guess that's just the way them wild horses run
Let 'em run

Long live cowgirls
Never gonna settle on down girls
Leave you in a lonely ghost town world
Where the sun don't rise, rodeo for one night
Love you like a mustang

Don't you wanna take me away?
Lay me on down, girl

Do you hide your phone? Did you change my name?
When he wants to go to our go-to place
Do you tell him you can't? Then go out of your way

I can turn any day to Saturday night, if I want to
And most the time I want to
I can still paint a picture of a hemlock view
My mountains had smoke, but the ones that were blue that we'd buy then
Were the ones I spent a little more time in
Between the hangovers and the handcuffs
It’s been a minute since I had one in my hand, 'cause

Everybody says it's gonna be the death of me
But these days I’m livin' on the side of alive
Just 'cause I smile through my sobriеty
Don't mean it ain't chillin' in the back of my mind
I ain't sayin' I swore it off for good
I’m just sayin’ I'm doin’ thе best I can
But what do you expect from a redneck?
Hell, I was born with a beer in my hand

When I was puttin' 'em down, they put me through hell
Put some scars on some trucks, myself as well
But if I never did put that can to my mouth
I wouldn't have nothin’ I could sing about

Yeah, everybody says it's gonna be the death of me
But these days I'm livin' on the side of alive

Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me ""forever,"" now you still can't call me back

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks

安物のウイスキーが俺の心を癒してくれる

助手席ではラブラドールがくつろいでいる
君の髪についた砂が俺の目に入ってきて
ビーチのせいにしてくれ　大の男は泣かない
あの壊れた地下室のソファを覚えてるかい？
俺がラブソングを歌っていると君は
君の母さんがどうして指輪を質に入れて出て行ったかを教えてくれるんだ
すべて、すべて覚えているよ

閉店時間の冷え切った態度
君は俺に日が昇るまで一緒に居てほしいと懇願したのに
おかしな言葉が口から零れる
大人の男の心が壊れたときは
写真と過ぎ去った時間
君は飲んでるときだけそんな風に笑うんだ
したくないけど、そうしてしまうよ
君と過ごした夜の、一瞬一秒を思い出す

あなたは心を癒すためなら何でも飲む
でも私の心はいつになったら癒してくれるの？
あなたといると、まるで夏の暑さに熱せられたコンクリートの上を歩いてるようで
二人の魂が出会うとき、それは地獄のように燃え上がる
あなたはあなたがいつも誓っていたような男にはなれないわ
でも、あの88年型フォードで歌うあなたのことを忘れない

Straßenhunde sind fürs Ausschlafen gemacht
Ich bin seit vier Uhr wach
In deinem schlimmsten Moment bist du besser als meine besseren Tage
Es gab keine Sonne in L.A
Seit du aus Sarahs Wohnung ausgezogen bist

Ich liebe die Geschichten deiner Mutter über dich als Kind
Ich hörte, du hast einen Job im East Village bekommen
Nun, arbeitest für einigе Leute, die dеinen Namen nicht kennen
Nun, wirst du nicht all diese verschwendeten Tage verpassen?
Wir saßen herum, tranken bei Sarah

Komm nicht zurück, Geliebter, ich bin stolz, dass du hinterm Horizont bist
Wir wussten immer, dass du die bessere Hälfte unserer guten Zeiten warst
Diese Hinterhoflichter scheinen nicht so hell ohne dein Gesicht
Draußen bei Sarahs Wohnung

Und du hast letzte Woche angerufen, nur um zu reden
Ich falle immer noch auseinander, wie ich es immer tun werde
Und dein Picknickstuhl steht einfach da im Hof
Und ich musste meine alte Gitarre verkaufen

Komm nicht zurück, Geliebter, ich bin stolz, dass du hinterm Horizont bist
Wir wussten immer, dass du die bessere Hälfte unserer guten Zeiten warst
Diese Hinterhoflichter scheinen nicht so hell ohne dein Gesicht
Draußen bei Sarahs Wohnung

Du wirst immer ein Stück von mir, ein Stück von mir sein
Wir fuhren diese Straße, die wir kennen, mindestens eine Million Mal
Ich hab's so verdammt satt, diese leere Einfahrt zu sehen

Komm nicht zurück, Geliebter, ich bin stolz, dass du hinterm Horizont bist

She's got a need to leave you wantin' more
She loves hard love and metaphors
Leave your shoes off at the door
'Cause dinner's waitin' on you
Grand things don't impress her much
She's keen to smaller acts
She likes honey in her coffee
And boys that use their backs

Friday afternoon at the Mercury Lounge
She loves a Prince song and a live sound
Never needs much and sure knows how to dance
All the money in the world couldn't make her smile
Shе prefers things that are worth whilе
Like small towns, that old style, and smaller acts

There ain't no love a man can find
You'd feel her in a room if you was blind
There ain't a grand thing a man can do
She'll only love you for you

She's satisfied in the scorchin' summer
Like the trees and stars she's layin' under
They're fine bein' right where they are
Give her a buzz and a beat-down boy
She hates bullshit and loves the noise
Of a coastal town the early parts of fall

There ain't no love a boy can find
You'll feel her in a room if you was blind
There ain't a thing a man can do
She'll only love you for you


There ain't no love a man can find

Eighteen years old, full of hate
They shipped me off in a motorcade
They said, ""Boy, you're gonna fight a war
You don't even know what you're fighting for""
I lost friends in the August heat
At night it was God I'd always meet
I said, ""Lord, won't you bring me home?
I've got women in the West I wanna hold""

And I lost you in a waitin' room
After sleepin' there for a week or two
Doctor said he did all he could
You were the last thing I had that was good
So I walked miles on the Tulsa streets
Light started beamin' in from the east
6 AM and fucked up again
Askin' God where the hell He'd been

He said the sun's gonna rise tomorrow
Somewhere on the east side of sorrow
You better pack your bags west
Stick out your chest
And then hit the road
The sun's gonna rise tomorrow
Somewhere on the east side of sorrow
Don't give it a reason to follow
Let it be, then let it go
Let it be, then let it go

Heard your brother lost his mind in the city last fall
Was it his blood, or his conscience, or the alcohol?
Did the Navy do him well or did he wind up sick
Like every other brave boy from these run down sticks?
Do you ever get tired of singin' songs
Like all your pain is just another fuckin' sing along?
If you ever get the time come on home
I heard Turnpike's back together and they're writin' songs

He said the sun's gonna rise tomorrow
Somewhere on the east side of sorrow
You better pack your bags west
Stick out your chest
And then hit the road
The sun's gonna rise tomorrow
Somewhere on the east side of sorrow
Don't give it a reason to follow
Let it be, then let it go
Let it be, then let it go"

But I been scrapin' by my whole damn life
And granddaddy worked a double 'til the day he died

There is concrete below me and a sky above so blue
I'm finally leaving Austin and I wish it was with you
I am just a sickness and you seem to be the cure
How much can a southern girl honestly endure?
Remember northwest mountains, they were snow-capped in June
You were napping on my arms on a Sunday afternoon
But, babe, I've gotta heal myself from the things I've never felt
Repression is my heaven but I'd rather go through hell

It's 'bout time that I left Austin
'Bout time you settled down
With a man who doesn't move as quick
As the train rolling through town
'Bout time that I face
The hard times I've let go
If love was just an ocean
I would drown before I float

You remember getting drunk on the outskirts of this town
When I gave you all I had, but it still let you down?
Everyone I've ever loved has either left or died
Wish I was born with concrete shoes, but I'm leaving tonight

It's 'bout time that I left Austin
'Bout time you settled down
With a man who doesn't move as quick
As the trains rolling through town
'Bout time that I face
The hard times I've let go
If love was just an ocean
I would drown before I float

Float
Float

There's concrete below me and a sky above so blue
People ruin people, I don't wanna ruin you
I am just a sickness and you seem to be the cure
How much can a southern girl honestly endure?

And I'm finally gone from Austin
You finally settled down
With a man who didn't move as quick
As the trains that rolled through town
I finally had to face
The hard times I've let go

If you're into masochistic bullshit
And every photograph
That's taken here is from the summer
Some guy won Olympic gold
Eight years ago, a distance runner
And that makes a lot of sense
This place is such great motivation
For anyone tryna move
The fuck away from hibernation

Named after high school friends' grandfathers
And motherfuckers here
Still don't know they caught the Boston bombers

I swear I feel my organs failing
I stopped caring 'bout a month ago
Sincе then it's been smooth sailing

I would leave if only I could find a reason
I'm mean because I grew up in New England
I got dreams, but I can't make myself believe them
Spend the rest of my life with what could have been
And I will die in the house that I grew up in

There's still so much that I have yet to know
We get dressed up just to go downtown
In some ego-filled late-night crowd
Seems to be where I feel the most alone

I'd like to get lost on some old back road
Find a shade tree and a honey hole
And talk to my grandpa again
And I see God in everything
The trees and pain and nights in the spring
So why do I still long for a home?

I'd like to lay in a field on a cozy blanket
And feel the fear of never wakin'
To know thе true warmth of the sun
I'd like to lovе my lady long and hard
And lay down lines of laymen guitar
Never leave her lovin' arms again

My exes hate me and my friends all miss me
I wanna drown in rotgut whiskey
Leave this small town for a while
Head to Paris on a late-night flight
Find a bar and get in a fight
Write a few poems on a sunny balcony

I wanna be a child climbin' trees somewhere
Breathin' in the fresh, outside air
And before I knew this life was unkind
I want a well-trained dog on a couple of acres
A kind, kind lady and a place to take her
Few good friends I can count on one of my hands

I know I'm bound to die one day
So when I reach those golden gates
I pray to say I did the best I can
Sit with my mother and the dearly departed
Send a prayer down to the broken-hearted
Let 'em know it all turns out just fine

To know me is to love me and to hate me is to wrong me
I prefer my nights so lonely
Love blues guitar, muscle cars, and gin
I'm a simple man, I don't need much
Just my simple songs and some human touch
I'm tired now so I'm bringin' my ass home

So let me go down the line
Let me feel it all, joy, pain, and sky

Enciende la tele, haz como si no me vieras
Dime que todo esta bien
Mi madre es una santa y me dijo si espero

Bueno, yo tampoco creo en complacer a la gente
Los putos teléfonos han arruinado este lugar
Conocí a un hombre en la ciudad de Nueva York, me dijo que los humanos no son tan bonitos
Como un día perfecto, lo perseguiremos todos los días

No quiero amor, amante, quiero la verdad

La gente muere mil veces para llegar a ser quienes son
Estabas orando al cielo en un vagón de tren tardío
Tu corazón conoce estaciones más profundas que mis ojos
Soy un deslizamiento de tierra autodestructivo si quieres ser la colina

Yo no soy impecable, tú tampoco
Por una vez en mi vida, voy a lograrlo
Si quieres dejar esto, está bien
Todo lo que debe ser está destinado a quedarse

¿Recuerdas saltar a la piscina cuando estábamos completamente vestidos en agosto?
Estábamos empapándonos, asfixiándonos, fumando en mi viejo apartamento de mierda
Luego cortaron todas las luces porque las facturas nunca se pagaron
Estábamos robándoles toda la energía a los vecinos en vacaciones

Yo no soy impecable, tú tampoco
Por una vez en mi vida, voy a lograrlo
Si quieres impecable, siempre perderé
Me diste tu amor, amante, me diste la verdad

Estaba solo
Estabas apostando por un perdedor, estabas llamando mi farol
Abrazarnos unos a otros, ¿nunca es suficiente?
Estabas ahí conmigo

No puedo detener esto, tú tampoco

And they cast him to the wolves when he wasn't well and fed

And then he told that old man he was never comin' back
To be cut down again in a town like that

Go on and put on that dress that all the bad boys like
I know your daddy ain't home, so ride with me tonight
You always wind up here in a puddle of tears
Them boys are out and they're angry and they're lookin' for blood
In the back of a blue, old pickup truck
You've got nowhere to go although you're all gussied up

There's so much whiskey in his Coke, it'll make her nose bend
But she swears that his love is a damn godsend
She known God since she was a child
She used to play in the yard and she would drеam of one day
'Til the world came around and took hеr dreamin' away
Told her how to dress and act and smile

She's an Oklahoma smokeshow
He's an asshole from back home
She'll never make it out alive
Of that small-town bar scene
Where small vices kill your big dreams
He'd take you home, but he's too drunk to drive

I've been here, I've been up all night
Thinkin' 'bout a life with you and I
One you'll never know
'Cause you're a small-town smokeshow
Well, I've been here, I've been up all night

The way I talk, I guess I got it from my pops
Product of some kneelin' down
In a town where the doors don't lock
And there's a million other people like me
From a scene a little more podunk than pop
I didn't choose being born in the sticks
And I'll be damned if I sound like something I ain't
For some folks, a backroad gets old
But for me, it just can't

'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country

Somewhere now, someone's out there
Sippin' on some hundred proof
Every day, a baby's born with some baby blues
A good ol' boy's got on his faded boots
Workin' a nine to five
I'm just another southern hell raiser
Ain't breakin' ground
Makin' sound for them drop-it-down tailgaters
But y'all, that's all I know to say
So if you think I'm full of it, ain't done it, check the resume

'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd

A 'Bama red 4Runner pulled into the party
With a 30-A sticker on the back windshield
Two-tone tank top slippin' off her shoulder

Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd

Kinda girl where your friends tell you don't F it up
Kinda girl that goes from tryin' to just to get her number
To slidin' through the summer to talkin' 'bout love

She asked me where I's from
I said, ""Somewhere ya never been to

Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water, she left her flip-flops
By my Red Wings on the beach

Yeah, but now I'm dodgin' potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissеd me
Tells me shе'd love Eastern Tennessee

Was some sand in my boots

I said, ""Let's go shoot tequila""
So, we walked back to that beach bar
She said, ""Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"" (Huh)
So, we drank bottom shelf
She said, ""Damn, that sky looks perfect""
I said, ""Girl, you've never seen stars
Like the ones back home""
And she said, ""Maybe I should, see 'em for myself""

I said, ""Meet me in the mornin'""
And she told me I was crazy

Plant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us

Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know

That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that

I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet

Turnin' some poor lost souls around, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down

Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em

'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book

A heart on the run keeps a hand on a gun
Can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on high
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing, “I thought it'd be me
Who helped him get home”
But home was a dream, one that I'd never seen
'Til you came along

So, girl, hang your dress out to dry, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
And carries this house on its stones like a piece of driftwood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good


So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room

You never listen to John Prine
You'd choose a city over two-lane Tennessee

And that don't make you Mr. Wrong, but you're far from Mr. Right
'Cause I'm a glass of red fine wine and you're a bad idea on ice
It's good that we're so different, but when the day is done
I sleep on my side and you sleep with everyone

I like my bed made and the smell of my own sheets
I bet you haven't slept in yours in weeks
I'm sun-kissed tan and you can't stand the beach
You like sour, I like sweet
I call my mom and when yours calls you, you let it ring

And that don't make you Mr. Wrong, but you're far from Mr. Right
'Cause I'm a glass of red fine wine and you're a bad idea on ice
It's good that we're so different, but when the day is done
I sleep on my side and you sleep with everyone

Oh, you sleep with everyone

I heard from a friend of a friend you got with both of them
And their friends said the same, we're just different, that's okay

And that don't make you Mr. Wrong, but you're far from Mr. Right
'Cause I'm a glass of red fine wine and you're a bad idea on ice

Ran my mouth to an out-of-towner
Learned a big lesson when I met the bouncer

Cracked a few jokes, we hit it off
Year down the road, I'm watchin’ her
Walk through the door with some new jerk
And we had it good, and it hurt so bad
But I had to stand my ground
Chase my pride with another round

And gets louder when I'm cheerin' on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear

It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi roads
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

Yeah it's, ""Yes sir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now""

But her kind eyes are on my heart
I've been swеatin' for my wages
But she'll cool me aftеr dark
How she'll cool me after dark
I know she'll cool me after dark


And I've been roofing houses atop of homes I can't afford
But I'm saving all my pennies and I'm prayin' to the Lord
One day we'll make it through all this barely gettin' by
I'm taking out my woman and we're dancin' barefoot tonight

Highway boys on the road tonight, got a gig out at the Ryman
Finally learned the hard way that all good things take time, friend
I heard they'll pay a lost soul to sing his songs true
That make a southern boy cry or turn a northeast man confused
And I awoke with a fever, sweatin' oceans again
There's mirrors in hotel rooms, but I do not recognize them
Maybe it's the feelin' that I get in my sleep
That all the memories in my mind are only mine to keep

I wanna ride that K-10 to way back when
Sleep next to the river, hear it rushin' again
Get my no-good soul back to wherе it belongs
And do my best to keep truth in songs
And do my best to keep truth in songs

And all of my old friеnds miss havin' me around, but
Highways work both ways and I can't stand the liars in town
If you need me, you can find me slightly out of control
'Cause highway boys don't rest and don't hang hats 'til they're home
Highway boys on the road tonight, got a gig out at the Ryman
They finally found out the hard way that this sound I got is mine, man

So if you need me, call
If you're in love, fall
Just know that highway boys don't stick around at all

I wanna ride that K-10 to way back when
Sleep next to the river, hear it rushin' again
Get my no-good soul back to where it belongs
And do my best to keep truth in songs
And do my best to keep truth in songs

On a motorbike out to East LA
To find a white line, it's such a fine line
Between broken and lucky

Now it's April and I hate you and I'm headin' home

In coat pockets and cabinеtry
Are in a shoe box from when we once talked

Hand in mine like a Heaven-sent hymn
Moving and shaking like the ramblers do

You bring Heaven down to me
Coursin' through my blood as I breathe
I bet the angels are jealous of a girl I know
She takes my stain and makes me white as snow

I hear Jesus makes sin white as linen
Like the sheets that we're in and your teeth when you're grinnin'
Take it away and you give it to God
Like the night you dumped out all the liquor I bought

There's a way the grass smells on a summer night
When it's freshly cut, the moisture's right
It's nights like these in the August heat
I think the devil's just another boy I can beat

Y sé que mi hogar no está lejos de aquí
Desde el atardecer hasta el amanecer
Hay un lugar para un buen descanso en mis cálidos brazos, cariño
Y encontré a Dios en tus ojos, querida

Y estás sonriendo como un vándalo

Sólo voy tan lejos como sopla el viento

I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walkin' out
Or across some parking lot, hidin' behind her sister
I'd look up, and she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes when you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines, closin' in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hittin' a little too close to home
She's so far gone, but she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms, right down the road
And I never thought

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes when you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

Her mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town, sometimes and I see you sittin' there with him
And I wanna jump out, I wanna fight
I wanna say, ""**** that guy"" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought

That she would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes when you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
They don't want me to know

And all your old shoes are lookin' brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance to
Heavy into everything, ready for the next thing
To catch your eye for a while, then you're over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shine's gone
Like you always do, but you don't know it yet, but

Woah, woah
Woah, woah

Woah, woah

Make you wish that you were sleepin' in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinkin' maybe it's me
I'm gonna make you miss me

You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot in the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Every boy you ever met, was too easy to forget
Well, I ain't goin' out like that

Make you miss me
Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand

5:34 AM, I was about to start my day
But she lay in there across me, so I stayed anyway
Arms tied, legs numb, her wrapped around my knee
Sweetest of the sunflowers, how you're the sun to me

I don’t recall what you were wearing on the first night we met
Besides the subtle cloud around you from my last cigarette
And you come from a good place with a happy family
The only bad you've ever done was to see the good in me

'Cause I’ve been livin', waitin' on the day
That the good Lord willin', sends you out my way
I'vе seen hard times, bad luck, all that in-between
Sweetest of thе sunflowers, how you're the sun to me

And I remember being younger and my mother told me true
Find someone who grows flowers in the darkest parts of you
Take heed when things get hard and don't you ever turn around
'Cause you’ll find someone, someday, somewhere
That grows you to the clouds

And you walked me home that evening when I could barely walk
And you spoke to me so sweetly on the days I couldn’t talk
And now I'm seeing clearly and I’m growing up so free
Sweetest of the sunflowers, how you're the sun to me

'Cause I've been livin’, waitin' on the day
That the good Lord willin', sends you out my way
I've seen hard times, bad luck, all that in-between

I've got some good friends with some loose ends that remind me of myself
They can drink as much as me and they can smoke me half to hell
And by the end of these songs when we bring our asses home
They'll all be thankin' God that they're not in this pain alone

And this world has been so cruel to me and it's been the same to them
But I don't mind sharin' my sweet depression
With some boys who act just like me and a girl who does the same
I don't know how I got here, but I'm glad as hell I came

Come as you are, however broken
And we will see if we can make you whole again
Come as you are, with your heart wide open
The bridges that you've burned, they are still there, just floatin'

Remember us in our bright-eyed days, too young to go inside
Sittin' drunk on curbs, tryna get ourselves a rise
Of the pretty girls who walk down there on Elgin Avenue
Oklahoma sure is flat, but it has itself a view

And how am I supposed to know the good times that I'm in
If the good is only seen when I'm lookin' back at them?
The boys are gettin' off work and they're haulin' on home
If I am meant for anything, it's to show you you're not alone

Come as you are, however broken
And we will see if we can make you whole again
Come as you are, with your heart wide open
The bridges that you've burned, they are still there, just floatin'

And I'm finding out that love ain't what love's cut out to be

Punch a hole in your damn dashboard and forget the girl you are

But I'd rather let it lie than hurt a sweet girl I know
And it's getting dark now, so won't you just stay?
And I'll tell you that I love you 'til the leaving goes away

Until the leaving leaves this house, no, we ain't going out
'Til I make some promises that I can't keep
And I wish I could explain how the toxins in my brain
Get me so damn down sometimes I can't speak
And you'll try to understand why I can't be a better man
But it's hard when I'm yelling at you in the street
So if leaving comes to staying and you walk yourself away
Leave knowing that no one could love you more than me

And I hope the world don't mind all the simple things I ask
Like a porch with good lighting and to hear my lady laugh
And I'll act indifferent because I don't wanna leave
'Cause leaving's for a younger man that I don't wanna be

Until the leaving leaves this house, no, we ain't going out
'Til I make some promises that I can't keep

Well, my buckle makes impressions
On the inside of her thigh
There are little feathered Indians
Where we tussled through the night
If I'd known she was religious
Then I wouldn't have came stoned
To the house of such an angel
Too fucked up to get back home

Lookin' over West Virginia
Smokin' Spirits on the roof
She asked ""Ain't anybody told ya
That them things are bad for you?""
I said, ""Many folks have warned me
There's been several people try
But up 'til now, there ain't been nothin'
That I couldn't leave behind""

Hold me close, my dear
Sing your whisperin' song
Softly in my ear
And I will sing along
Honey, tell me how your love runs true
And how I can always count on you
To be there when the bullets fly
I'd run across the river just to hold you tonight

Well, my heart is sweatin' bullets
From the circles it has raced
Like a little feathered Indian
Callin' out the clouds for rain
I'd go runnin' through the thicket
I'd go careless through the thorns
Just to hold her for a minute
Though it'd leave me wantin' more

Hold me close, my dear
Sing your whispering song
Softly in my ear
And I will sing along
Honey, tell me how your love runs true
And how I can always count on you

And I'm the same girl you fell for when we were kids

But I guess sometimes that the end is better
'Cause love turns to loss as the time goes by

'Cause I got too high, and you got scared
And the cops just laughed?
We can't make rent, so we window-shop
In the Upper West Side, oh, my God
Could you imagine that?

I won't be alone for the rest of my life
I'll build a boat for when the river gets high
And I'll meet a girl in the heat of July
And I'll tell her so she knows
That I'm broke, but I'm real rich in my head
That I broke a bone that never healed in my hand
So, when I hold her close
I might loosen my grip, but I won't ever let her go
I won't ever let her go

When forever was a sentence, sentence to death
Oh, when you were a running tear, I was a drop of sweat
And the edges of your soul, I haven't seen yet
Now I'm glad I get forever to see where you end
To see where you end"

How do I make you fall in love with me?
And how would I let you know I care?
And how would I say that the man you're laying with
Is not the man that should be laying there?

How would a boy like me put it?
A man with some sense probably wouldn't
But I don't give a damn, I am not a smart man
I'm gonna say some words I shouldn't

And I had a dream I was falling
And maybe that's a fucked up metaphor
Maybe it just means when I meet you in my dreams
Nothing stops me from going through the floor

And I know all the bad things about you
But I still think you're the purest of our kind
I remember being younger with an awful pining hunger
For a good that a boy could never find
And a fear of a man so left behind
So I guess I'll just love you from the window
While you're dancing with the charmers in the room
And I'll sneak out that door like I have a time before
And just let that lost love loom
And just let that lost love loom

And how do I make you fall in love with me?
Is it lost in the emptiness of apathy?
Should I fight for it like war? Should I nail it down to boards?
Or do I live in a love I'm dying for?

How do I make you fall in love with me?
And how do I let you know I care?
And how would I say that the man you're laying with
Is not the man that should be laying there?"

Break me down and beat me blue
There ain't a beauty on the planet comin' close to you
In the harsh heat of summer or a cool, crisp fall
I'd rather be ruined by you than be loved at all

Well, my chest-talking, jaywalking, Levi jean queen
I've been everywhere, I swear, and you're the finest I've seen

Break me down and beat me blue
There ain't a kindness on the planet that compares to you
In the dark of the night or the light of day
I'll long for you tomorrow as I did today

Well, my daydreaming, people-pleasing, bright-on-dark-days girl
I've fell hard and I've loved wide, and you're the rarest in the world

Well, I've been known to chase extremes
But in my dreams, it seems I'm only chasin' you
Break me, beat me, tear me down, and drag my ass all over town
I'll whisper you these sonnets 'til I'm blue
Oh, I'll whisper you these sonnets 'til I'm blue

Break me down and beat me blue
There ain't a heaven on the planet that saves me like you
The hallelujahs, oh, 'til you go on for miles

Someday, I'll make it there, I swear
To that place that haunts my dreams at night
Singing Heavenly Highway Hymns all the way up
To that beautiful, old countryside
Someday, I'll find the words to explain
All the good times that echo through my mind
Your grin in the morning's a warm southern sun
Or seeing double when those chemicals align
Just some kids who needed love, using laughter as their drug
Doing their best to tow that hard line
Someday, I will lie under blue skies
In a hayfield that holds me like home
And I'll ask forgiveness with God as my witness
For straying so far on my own

Today, I'll hold my head up high
Knowing someday, comes one day at a time
Today, there's a sun setting soon as suppers warm
Today, I've got someday on my mind

Someday, I'll call up all my old friends
And we'll catch up with too many beers
Pull an all-nighter, sitting around fire
For the first time in so many years
Someday

Someday, I will come to my senses
Stop sitting on fences in fear
And I will realize after all of this time
That someday was always just right here

Today, I'll hold my head up high
Knowing someday has been here the whole damn time
There's a sun set setting, I ain't forgetting
The blood that made my heart warm
Today, I found what I was searching for

Someday, I will send you a postcard
From the place that I'm smiling tonight
I sang Heavenly Highway Hymns all the way up
To this beautiful, warm countryside"

You to go and fall in love with

Can't say I'm proud of that, but
I've turned the page on the old me

Você tem muita coragem, não tem, querida?
Eu só encho a cara porque você me faz fazer isso
Você 'tá dizendo pra todos os seus amigos que eu sou louco
Como se eu fosse o único
Por que você os apedrejaria se você
Tinha um ou dois grandes desejos?
Morando nessa grande casa de vidro com uma bela visão
Eu achei que você sabia que

Eu tive ajuda
Não é como se eu pudesse fazer toda essa bagunça por conta própria
Não aja como se você não tivesse me ajudado a puxar a garrafa pra fora da prateleira
Estive bem envolvido em todo final de semana, se não percebeu
Eles dizem, ""Trabalho em equipe faz o sonho acontecer""
É lógico que eu tive ajuda (Ajuda)

(Ajuda)

Você achou que eu levaria a culpa por termos terminado
Ande por aí como se você não fosse a culpada de algo
Já perdeste o jogo que esteve fugindo
Parece que está te alcançando, né
Você acha que é tão inocente
Depois de toda a merda que fez
Eu não sou um anjo, você não é enviada dos céus
Não consigo nos tirarmos disso

Eu tive ajuda
Não é como se eu pudesse fazer toda essa bagunça por conta própria
Não aja como se você não tivesse me ajudado a puxar a garrafa pra fora da prateleira

É necessário dois pra quebrar um coração no meio, ooh
Querida, você me põe a culpa e, querida, eu ponho a culpa em você
Aw, se não for essa a verdade (Oh)

Não é como se eu pudesse fazer toda essa bagunça por conta própria
Não aja como se você não tivesse me ajudado a puxar a garrafa pra fora da prateleira

You might tell me to empty out my whiskey
Or try changin' what I'm holdin' in my hand
Try another liquor, try another brand
But it don't matter if I got my lips on a different drink on a different night
Yeah, the second that I take a sip all I'm gonna think

And I'll be damned if I sound like something I ain't

But for me, it just can't

Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country

Somewhere now, someone's out there
Sippin' on some hundred proof
Every day, a baby's born with some baby blues
A good ol' boy's got on his faded boots
Workin' a nine to five
I'm just another southern hell raiser
Ain't breakin' ground
Makin' sound for them drop-it-down tailgaters
But y'all, that's all I know to say
So if you think I'm full of it, ain't done it, check the resume

Therе's a train headin' west to south Toledo
And if thе dogs don’t sell me, asleep I’ll go
Dreamin' as I’m steamin' past miles of ground
Through the souls and hymnals that built these towns
Won't stay too long and leave too soon
The best time for goin' is when the goin’ scares you

There's some headlights burning down the highway
And I think that I may just hitch me a ride
'Cause I'm a traveling man by trade, sir
We're all runnin' from the things inside

There's some headlights burnin' down the highway
And I think that I may just hitch me a ride
'Cause I'm a traveling man by trade, sir

The kids are in town for a funeral
So pack the car and dry your eyes
I know they got plenty of young blood left in 'em
And plenty nights under pink skies you taught 'em to enjoy

So clean the house, clear the drawers, mop the floors, stand tall
Like no one's ever been here before or at all
And don't you mention all the inches that are scraped on the doorframe
We all know you tiptoed up to 4'1"" back in '08

If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppiеs
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God hеard you comin'

The kids are in town for a funeral
And the grass all smells the same as the day you broke your arm swingin'
On that kid out on the river
You bailed him out, never said a thing about Jesus or the way he's livin'

If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppies
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God heard you comin'

(Strum it)

If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppies
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God heard you comin'

The kids are in town for a funeral
So pack the car and dry your eyes
I know they got plenty of young blood left in 'em
And plenty nights under pink skies you taught 'em to enjoy"

Morgan Wallen (ترجمه‌ی فارسی) Lyrics
2 AM at a Broadway bar
ساعت 2 بامداد تو یه بار تو خیابون برادوی
She's puttin' her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
شماره اش رو میزنه تو گوشیم (دخترای تنهای اهل برادوی)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don't mean
دوتا بطری آبجو بادلایت تا آخر خورده شده،  و چیزایی میگه که منظوری نداره
And you know
و میدونی که

I met her down at Aldean's
تو رستوان بار ""اَلدنز نشویل"" دیدمش
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
گفت که حدود یک مایل دورتر من رو در حال قدم زدن دید
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
پسر خاله ام ""بین"" فقط میخواست تلفنش رو ازش بگیره (تا ازم فیلم نگیره) و همین لبخندش رو از بین بر
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
گفت زیادی مست و دیوونه ام، نحوه رقصیدنم رو دوست نداره
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
گفتم: مجبور نیستی بهم ملحق بشی. گفت شانسشو امتحان میکنه
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
از وقتی که نقشه ام شکست خورد یه جورایی دیوونه بودم
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
یه جورایی گم شدم، و این چیزی بود که فهمیدم
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around
دخترای مثل تو فقط میخوان من رو دور بزنن، دور بزنن، دور بزنن

Oh, there's two things that you'rе gonna find out
اوه، دوتا چیز هست که قراره بفهمی
They don't love you and they only lovе you right now
اونا عاشقت نیستن و فقط همین الان دوستت دارن
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
اگه زرنگ بودم، میموندم خونه
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
و دخترای اهل برادوی رو تنها میذاشتم (تنهاشون میذاشتم، تنهاشون میذاشتم)
Them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
دخترای تنهای اهل برادوی (تنهاشون میذاشتم، تنهاشون میذاشتم)
Leave them Broadway girls alone
دخترای اهل برادوی رو تنها میذاشتم

They town just told me, ""Don't trust 'em""
اهالی شهرشون بهم گفتن: بهشون (به دخترای برادوی) اعتماد نکن
Broadway girls a trap
دختر اهل برادوی یه تله است
They on me, they tryna finesse me
مهمون منن، سعی میکنن زرنگی کنن
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
منو با ""مرگان"" دیدن و میدونن رپ میکنم
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
اسب من (ماشینم) پورشه، بهم توجه میکنن
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
پریدم رو یه اسب، اونم نشست پشتم
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
رفتم بار تا واسش یه نوشیدنی بگیرم
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
بهم گفت رپ دوست نداره، آهنگ های ""پینک"" رو گوش میده
I can't run out of money
نمیتونم بی پول بشم (معنی دوم: نمیتونم بدون پول ادامه بدم)
The trenches love me forever
محله های فقیرو خلافکار همیشه دوستم دارن
They treat me like Ed in London
مثل ""اد شیرن"" تو لندن باهام رفتار میکنن
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
بردمش استخر، بعدش رایگان یه آبجو گرفتم
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
بوت های ""تیکوواس""، گیتار، سیگار، بار مشروب
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars
مثل ماشین ها سوار گاو نر میشه، معمولا با آدم معروفا خوب نیس

Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out
حالا، دوتا چیز هست که قراره بفهمی
They don't love you and they only love you right now
اونا عاشقت نیستن و فقط همین الان دوستت دارن
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
اگه زرنگ بودم، میموندم خونه
And leave them Broadway girls alone
و دخترای اهل برادوی رو تنها میذاشتم

Them Broadway girls alone
دخترای تنهای اهل برادوی
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
دخترای اهل برادوی، دخترای اهل برادوی

دخترای تنهای اهل برادوی

Oh, think I oughta settle down
اوه، فکر کنم باید به اینن وضع عادت کنم
And find me somethin' I can take back to my hometown, oh
و یه چیزی پیدا کنم تا بتونم باهاش برگردم به شهر خودم، اوه
But I told 'em that I'm savage
ولی بهشون گفتم که من رام نمیشم
They just tryna tell me there's
اونا فقط میخواستن بهم بگن:

There's two things that you're gonna find out
دوتا چیز هست که قراره بفهمی
They don't love you and they only love you right now

I can't find one good reason for leavin' here alone
With all this built-up anger and strangers to hold
90 proof ain't done nothin' but prove to me
Washed up and all alone is where you want me to be

So throw em' down, shot for shot
Till I can't feel the stool I'm sitting on
Walkin' round buzzin' like that ole neon sign on the wall
Blue eyes in the corner lookin' like she wants my number in her phone
So much for drinkin' alone

Buy a round of whisky sours, tip the band on the stage
She's looking at me like she might need a little scеnery change
She says lеt's go to my place as she jumps in the passenger seat
Safe to say this ain't where I thought this night would lead

Drivin' half of what it says to go on that speed limit sign
She's wantin' some of me, I'm just trying to stay between the lines
Screw it let's just pull over right here on the side of the road
So much for drinkin' alone

Sunday morning
Man, she woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours"

And you can’t stay

Lord knows it bothers me
Without you by my side
I can’t get no sleep
Nothin’ to do

But the thoughts in my mind
I weigh my heart tonight

Come again some other day

And I'm tired of it, tired of it

She was here, now she gone again (Need her back)
Now it's me and all my whiskey friends
And I'm tired of it (Hey), tired of it (Yeah, speak)

Dark brown skin, caught eye contact while walkin' in (On the walk up)
Perfect timing, get beside me, now we lockin' in (Linked in)
She like, ""Tell me how you want it, on the rocks again (What else?)
Lil' salt around the rim (Okay), filled to the top again?"" (Let's go)
Fell back, now I'm back in it
Del Dia shots got me sinning
Big racks, but these jeans skinny
Plain Richard Mille square business (Boss)
See me in the club two-steppin’
Diamonds ’round my neck square-dancing
You done made a gangster romantic
Fiendin' for your love, I’m an addict (Ayy)
So addicted, ain't nothin' we can do about it (Nah)
Country motherfucker, I say, ""What's up?"" she say, ""Howdy"" (Howdy)
Call you my lil’ cowgirl how you ride it like a stallion (Uh, uh)

And I'm tired of it, tired of it

Put you up and hide you on the shelf, I swear I'm through with you
You so hard to leave alone, it's always something new with you
Ain't no way to get her gone, gone, gone
So I guess I'm gonna tie one on
She's so cold, I had to go and pour you over ice
Way you got me locked down, you'd think whiskey was my wife
You so good, I had to take you home and hit it twice
Two of you gon' keep me up all night

And a Lonestar postcard postmarked with ""Missin' you""

When they line dance to ""Copperhead Road""

And others, they were born to run

Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky

Change the way the river flows

Like a whiskey shot at last call

Well, I go to work every Monday
Get to do something I love
And I make it home every evening
To an angel God sent from above
Got an eight point on camera from last year
That this season looks like a ten
I got a barn with a fridge full of cold beer
On the weekend it's full of good friends

I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees, thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
How'd a guy like me, who'd have been fine with three
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?

I got a half ton that's parked in the driveway
My dog wags his tail when he hears
I grew up in a good place to be from
My folks still got a bunch of good years

Now I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees, thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
How'd a guy like me, who'd have been fine with three
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?

I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand

Wind up with a five-leaf clover?

How'd a guy like me, who could've wound up with weeds
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?"

They beat us every damn year
It's been a minute since we pulled out a win
I loaded the truck down with beer
Drove down to watch ’em do it again
And they did so we went to the bar right after
Met a girl with a houndstooth print of her chapter on her shirt
And it turned into talkin' all night
She came back with me across the Vol' state line

Guess the joke’s on Alabama
'Cause they lost big this time
I got the number one pick, blonde hair, red lips
Brought her over to the other side
A little deep south Delta Gamma
Done found a Smoky Mountain man
Yeah, she was raised Roll Tide 'til the day she died
But ever since that night, she's been a Tennessee fan

She likes ridin' on them windin' roads
The smell of sweet pine in the air
I took her about as high as you could go, huh
You can still see the Tuscaloosa from there
And all them girls back home say, ""How could you love him?""
All them boys probably hate me for takin' her from 'em
Lord knows her mom and daddy’s jaw would drop
If they heard her singin’ every word of ""Rocky Top""

Guess the joke's on Alabama
’Cause they lost big this time
I got the number one pick, blonde hair, red lips
Brought her over to the other side
A little deep south Delta Gamma
Done found a Smoky Mountain man
Yeah, she was raised Roll Tide 'til the day she died
But ever since that night, she's been a Tennessee fan

Oh
Yeah, it's alright, let’s just call it even
'Cause she's all mine and she ain't ever leavin'
And she's damn fine in orange every weekend from now on
Yeah, she found home

Looks like the joke's on Alabama
'Cause they lost big this time
I got the number one pick, blonde hair, red lips
Brought her over to the other side
A little deep south Delta Gamma
Done found a Smoky Mountain man
Yeah, she was raised Roll Tide 'til the day she died
But ever since that night, she's been a Tennessee fan
Oh, she's been a Tennessee fan"

Few days before he turned 80
He was sitting out back in a rocker
He said ""What you been up to lately?""
I told him chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out
Said ""If you want my two cents on making a dollar count

Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt""

Before you get caught on that ladder
Let me tell you what it's all about
Find you a few things that matter
That you can put a fence around
And then he laid it out

Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send you prayers up and your roots down deep
And add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt

You can buy dirt
And thank the good Lord for it
'Cause He ain't makin' any more of it

So buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard

You're tellin' your buddies, three months in
That she ain't movin' in, the next thing you know

There goes the carpet but the deer head stays

Spend it all at a jewelry store
Gettin' down on one knee on hеr mama's porch
Just prayin' she don't say, ""No""

Sunburnt on a honeymoon beach and your

And there the next two or three years go

There's a test on the counter, next thing you know
She's standin' there cryin', noddin' her head yes
You're half excited, half scared to death

'Cause next thing you know
You're wearin' scrubs and a funny white hat and the
Doctor's sayin', how you doin' there dad and
Nobody's ever called you that
And you take that drive home slow
Next thing you know
It's first steps, first dates, first car
It's 11:01 wonderin' where they are
You're sayin' that USC's too far
It's amazing how fast seventeen years go

Next thing you know
You get to know your wife again and you're
More in love than you've ever been
With a lot of years of remember when's and still some down the road

'Cause next thing you know
You got a yard full of your kid's kids
And you take 'em to church, teach 'em to fish
And you, tell 'em stories every chance you get
About how fast this life down here can go

I love a first cast when the water's glass and the line starts to run
Or that first sip of a cold beer when the working week's done
I love the twilight in the morning 'fore the day wakes up
With the windows down on the first ride in a paid-up truck
And I love a slow down in a beach town with an ocean view
And I love a first fall Saturday trip down to Baton Rouge
And I love a six-string with the stars out and the campfire glow
But girl, that don't even come close

To the way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearin'
That look in your eye, girl, when you catch me starin'
And I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it
I can't imagine me livin' without this
Back forty view on our piece of ground
Watching you watch the sun going down
That's what my world spins around

Well, I finally get it now, when they say you know, you know
And yeah, girl, you had me from that first hello
And the only thing better is Heaven above
But until I get there, I'll never get enough of

The way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearin'
That look in your eye, girl, when you catch me starin', and
I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it
I can't imagine me livin' without this

Watching you watch the sun going down

The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
And I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearin'
And that look in your eye, girl, when you catch me starin', and
I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it
I can't imagine me livin' without this

Where you went, where you've been, who you're with
Losin' my patience and checkin' locations
And rereadin' texts that you sent

I-I would cry one, two, three too many times
Just wastin' my prime on a guy who was more wrong than right

Now I don't even know what I'm missin'
Don't care what it is or it isn't
Don't need your attention (No), or your time
They say, ""Did you hear?""
I say, ""No thanks I'm fine""
I think I could wish you the best
The truth is I couldn't care less
How sweet it is to be so (So), so indifferent

June came and went
When's your birthday again? Did I miss it? My bad, that's on me
I see your truck and I don't give a —
And it don't make my heart skip a beat

I-I like not wonderin' where you are tonight
It feels so nice finally being on the other side

Scared of nothing and I'm scared to death

You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain

I got saved in the same Red River
The same Red River tryna drown me
It ain't knocking me down, I'm standing my ground
With the whole world falling all around me
I keep running, but I'm standing still
Pray for peace, but I need thе thrill

My big brother rode an Indian Scout
It was black like his jacket
American Spirit hangin' outta his mouth
Just like our daddy
He kick-started that bike one night and broke mama's heart
He pointed that headlight West, out where the wild things are

He'd call me up every couple of weeks
From South California
Talk about the desert and the Joshua Tree
And his pretty girl stories
And how he bought an Airstream trailer and a J-45 guitar
Said, ""Little brother, you'd love it out here, out where the wild things are""

Oh, oh-oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, oh-oh, the nights ignite like gasoline
And light up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
Out where the wild things are

I called my brother from the back of that plane
The second I made it
We started drinkin' on the strip in L.A
And then it got crazy
Ended up at a house in the hills with some Hollywood stars
Kissin' on a blonde in a backyard pool, out where the wild things are
(Oh, yeah)

Couple iron horse rebels
Wild as the devil
I knew I had to move back East
Said goodbye to my brother
At the end of that summer
But I knew he'd never leave

Oh, oh-oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, where the nights ignite like gasoline
And oh, oh-oh, them Indian Scouts, man, they're built for speed
And oh, oh-oh, they said he hit that guard rail at half past three
Lit up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
We buried him out in the wind 'neath the West Coast stars
Out where the wild things are

Out where the wild things are"

I fell in love at sweet sixteen
Ain't never felt a cut that deep
I blamed him and he blamed me
I cried so hard I couldn't breathe
So, I swore off love for quite sometime
'Til the bad boy took me for a ride
And that went how you'd think it'd go
And I said, ""I guess I'll die alone""

I got good at sleepin' by myself
I got good at not needin' no one else

But now I think it's happenin' again
You put a brand new kind of wind back in my sails
Took my heart off of the shelf
And you're not nothin' like I've known
I'm already scared to let you go
Tonight, I'm layin' in your arms
Prayin' that the third time's the charm

You're patient and you're twice as kind
And there's a book that says that's some good sign
You calm my crazy every time
You think I'm kind of crazy, but you don't mind

Now I think it's happenin' again
You put a brand new kind of wind back in my sails
Took my heart off of the shelf
And you're not nothin' like I've known
I'm already scared to let you go
Tonight, I'm layin' in your arms
Prayin' that the third time's the charm

Ooh-ooh-ooh

I could probably get back up
If this goes south and I lose your love
But I don't wanna know a world
Where you're not mine, and I'm not your girl

Baby, I think it's happenin' again
You put a brand new kind of wind back in my sails
Took my heart off of the shelf
And you're not nothin' like I've known

No, there ain't much, man

Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart

Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red taillights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now

But longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart

You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
Been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the bordеr and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to bе livin'

See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone


You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision

I bought a Harvard sweatshirt off the Goodwill rack
Makes some people wonder if I'm smart like that
And that guitar layin' on the chair is worn out like my boots
Makes it look like I can play it better than I do

But nobody buys it when we walk in
They say there ain't no way that she's with him
In a world where nothing is what it seems
Ain't no one more surprised than me

It's funny how some strangers like to size me up
This attitude it makes me street and this accent makes me dumb
I can tell 'em I've got pirate blood or ancient royalty
Thеre's no end to the liеs that I could get 'em to believe

But nobody buys it when we walk in
They say there ain't no way that she's with him
In a world where nothing is what it seems
Ain't no one more surprised than me


Must've done somethin' right
Somethin' right
In another life

'Cause nobody buys it when we walk in
They say there ain't no way that she could be with him
In a world where nothing is what it seems
Ain't no one more surprised than me

I was all but twenty-two, I think at the time
I'd been out on the road lonely at night
And it'd been a while, huh, so it was on my mind
Well, I saw him walk in with his cowboy hat
And I thought to myself, ""I could use some of that""
His boots like glass on a sawdust floor, huh
Had moves like nothin' I'd ever seen before
So I walked right up, and I pulled him to the side
I handed that man a beer and looked him in the eyes
And I said, ""Baby, I think you're gonna wanna hear this""
Then I told him

""Excuse me
You look like you love me
You look like you want me to want you to come on home
And, baby, I don't blame you
For lookin' me up and down across this room
I'm drunk and I'm ready to leavе
And you look like you love me""

Wеll, I was down at a local beer joint with a few of the guys
When this cute little country girl caught my eye
And, boy, let me tell you
She was the prettiest thing I'd ever seen in a pair of boots
Well, she walked right up to me, handed me a beer
Gave me a look like, ""Let's get outta here""
And that's when I realized that she was every cowboy's dream come true
She told me this right here
She said

""Excuse me
You look like you love me
You look like you want me to want you to come on home
And, baby, I don't blame you
For lookin' me up and down across this room
I'm drunk and I'm ready to leave
And you look like you love me""
Alright, now


So if you ever see a man in a cowboy hat
And you think to yourself, ""I could use some of that""
Don't waste your time
Just give him this here line
Goes a little like this

""Excuse me
You look like you love me
You look like you want me to want you to come on home
And, baby, I don't blame you
For lookin' me up and down across this room
I'm drunk and I'm ready to leave

My folks still talk, but they speak in these two-word sentences
I'm sayin' too much, but you know how it gets out here

But I still recall how the leather in your car feels
And at the end of it all, I just hope that your scars heal

Well, I leaned in for a kiss thirty feet from where your parents slept
And I looked so confident, babe, I swear I was scared to death
My hands gripped the wheel, I smiled stupid the whole way home
Well, those five words in my head, you said, ""I'll never let you go""

Workin' my way through a middle of June
Midnight thunderstorm
There was somethin' in the headlights
That stopped me on a dime
Well, she was scared to death
So I said, ""Climb in,"" and in she climbed
Oh, yeah

Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe
With a tear in her blood-stained shirt
She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to
I knew what had happenеd to her
I didn't load her down with questions
That girl had been through еnough
I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes
And asked her where he was

I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under his seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again when he said to me
""Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck""

Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came
So I kicked in his double-wide door
I let the hammer drop before he got
To that 12 he was reachin' for
I didn't try to hide my pistol
I didn't even try to run
I just sat on the porch, smokin' one of his cigarettes
And waited for the cops to come

I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under his seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again when he said to me

Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me, Lord (Oh)

It's been sixty months and she still comes
To see me from time to time
It was worth the price to see a brighter side
Of the girl I picked up that night
And I might be here forever
It ain't paradise, that's true
But it's a whole hell of a lot better
Than the place I sent him to
Yeah

I will give some worn down excuse
'Bout my misguided judgements of substance abuse
I know that you'll stay out of pure sympathy
There ain't no use in lovin' a let-down like me

I'll let you down, darlin', down, babe, just like I did before
You'll just keep on slammin' closed hollow unlocked doors
I'll let you down, darlin', down, babe, just like times before
You'll just keep on crawlin' back and beggin' me for more

I will leave you broken and in ruins
Call you when the work's through just to find out what you're doin'
So I can let you down for the hundredth last time
'Cause lettin' down's a pick-me-up for me and my boys' kind

I'll let you down, darlin', down, babe, just like I did before
You'll just keep on slammin' closed hollow unlocked doors
I'll let you down, darlin', down, babe, just like times before
You'll just keep on crawlin' back and beggin' me for more

And I know that you know that you make my spine shiver
But my past lives inside me and it's branched out from my liver
When I am not the evil that you make me out to be
I will let you down and that's a damn guarantee

I'll let you down, darlin', down, babe, just like I did before

Rail-tie worker, I've been layin' ties on cold ground
But I'm leavin' this evenin' on the same tracks I laid down
There's some boys out in Jersey that are callin' me out by name
I got a reason to believe I ain't glory-bound anyway

And if you're readin' this letter tell my mother and my brother that I love 'em
He's got the better blood of my old man and our cousins
But he made a bad deal with some boys out on Oak Island
And if he don't pay they say they're bound to find him

But if I find 'еm on that island first
The worst is yet to come
'Causе no blood in the mud I's raised in
Spent life on the run

And I went to Jay's tavern and it happens that them boys were there
Recognized his backside from the color of our mother's hair
And my brother found another way to make himself a decent little livin'
He turned around and found himself a lickin' only blood could give him
And I told him I was there to keep him clear of that island
He said, ""I love you Mickey, but I found out that I'm them""
And I got bad blood with some blood out on Oak Island
And if he stays I say I am bound to find him

But if I find 'em on that island first
The worst is yet to come
'Cause no blood in the mud we's raised in

You took a train to the south side of Boston
You showed me where your old man stayed
Took twenty-eight years of blood I was lost in
To feel loved on my own birthday
And I always felt like I's in between somethin'
Like home and somewhere far away
But tonight on the west side in a bar out in Brooklyn
I saw tears outline your face

How lucky are we?
It's been a hell of a week, but you're all grown now
There's smoke seepin' out of your bloody teeth
But you're home somehow

And I'll be upstairs with the guitar I's given
When I was barely fourteen
When did McGlinchеy's get so crowded
And why are thе crowds so damn green?
I lost my mind on the streets of the city
And maybe I lost all hope too
Took twenty-eight years of blood pumpin' through me
To get to this evening with you

How lucky are we?
It's been a hell of a week, but we're all grown now
There's smoke seepin' out of the bar down the street

My old man bought a big bass boat
When I think of that summer of hope, I choke
'Cause even if we didn't catch a little bit of somethin'
We'd park that boat by the bluff at the Days Inn

I got a need to find trouble when things are alright
I pine for pain in the morning light
And even with my baby sittin' next to me
I'm a self-sabotagin' suicide machine

And you're goin', goin', goin'
'Til the Lord calls you home in
Your work boots and your worn coveralls
And you'll show them, show them, show them
With your high collateral loan on
That home where your children play with dolls

'Cause I was raised by a woman who was hardly impressed
And I carry that shit real deep in my chest
'Cause I ain't ever been one for cheap excuses
And apologies have always been a little late or useless
But if you give me four minutes and a little bit of time
I'll make them old days an old friend of mine
And I can talk to God and I can pray all day
But you can't heal somethin' that you never raised

And you're goin', goin', goin'
On Thanksgiving Day when
You're sneakin' off to drink some alcohol
And you'll show them, show them, show them
While you're kissin' all the knees of
Every scrape and every bloody fall

Don't get angry, listen to the sounds
Them good times will find their way back around
And I’ve got the answers, go on and touch my skin
Them better days always come back again

This life's a boat, boy, it all comes in waves
On the radio, her laughter and sweet mistakes
And I wasn't loved well as a younger child
So I’ll pray these better, unstable days, they stay awhile

So don't get hateful, Lord, hot damn
There's a fire burnin' in the back forty
I'm still findin' out who the hell I am
And I'm so tired of wastin' it away
Gonna find the time to realize

She always told me there’d be times like this
With a blue guitar, a city bar and a streetlight kiss
But I've never known quite what I deserve
You try so hard and wind up gettin’ burned

So don't get hateful, Lord, hot damn

The only time I got to praying for a red light
Was when I saw your destination as a deadline
""This is normal conversation, babe, it's all fine""
Making quiet calculations where the fault lies
This is good land, or at least it was
It takes a strong hand and a sound mind

The college kids are getting so young, ain't they?
They're correcting all the grammar on our spray paint
And I even gave up driving after nightfall
I got tired of the frat boys with their brights on
This is good land, or at least it was
It takes a strong hand and a sound mind

It makes me smile to know when things get hard
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far
Ooh-ooh, you'll bе far from here
And, while I clеan shit up in the yard
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far, far from here

So, pack up your car, put a hand on your heart
Say whatever you feel, be wherever you are
We ain't angry at you, love
You're the greatest thing we've lost
The birds will still sing
Your folks will still fight
The boards will still creak
The leaves will still die
We ain't angry at you, love
We'll be waiting for you, love

And we'll all be here forever
And we'll all be here forever
We sure will

We're overdue for a revival
We spent so long just getting by
That's the thing about survival
Who the hell, who the hell likes livin' just to die?
You told me you would make a difference
Well, I got drunk and shut you down
It won't be by your own volition
If you step foot outside this town
But it's all we've had
For always

So, pack up your car, put a hand on your heart
Say whatever you feel, be wherever you are
We ain't angry at you, love
You're the greatest thing we've lost
The birds will still sing

The boards will still creak

Man on the porch singin' baritone
Tan line leads to that gentle place
Between her collarbone and her stone-cold face

Dockhand boys all say goodbye
To the women that they swear are gonna be their wives
They’ll be gone by the wintertime
And they don't wanna bother with no friend of mine

Wet, hot, American nights
Shake your body dry under coastline light
Wet, hot, American nights
We snuck our Fords to the shore and drank a bottle bone-dry
We snuck our Fords to the shore and drank a bottle bone-dry

Davey got back from his first tour
He ain't the same boy that he was before
Twenty’s too young to nearly die
American boys are a friend of mine

Delco Danny cut a deal with the dealer
That he met out at the Rivers Casino
He got caught countin' cards, then them spades broke his heart
Then the Point Breeze boys broke his nose
Heard Mary got that job that she wanted out of town
She was better than the sum of all of us anyhow
She still stops by whenever she can
She's tougher than my brother with a balled left hand

Wet, hot, American nights
Shake your body off under coastline light

We snuck our Fords to the shore and drank a bottle bone-dry

Coffee cold this mornin'
You're gettin' rid of me
Got drunk, fell asleep and woke up
In Eastern Tennessee

Woke up on the wrong side
Of a lifelong fight between
Who I was, who I am
And which one's right

Baby's out the bathwater
He ain't got no chance
Oklahoma knows the old ya
So, boy, get up and dance

These songs used to free me
Now there's nothin' free in this
Just 808 beats, what we used to be
And back door politics

Now everyone I know's an outlaw
Country to their core
But the only outlaw I've known
Served in the Corps

And I ain't heard ""Shakе the Frost""
In a couple years or morе"

I woke up with a headache today
'Cause I've got mortgage due
And an empty bed to make
And girl, it's funny to me
How much I hate your memory
But unlike you, it'll always be me
No matter how bad I wanted to leave

Started smoking cigarettes again
But I only light a few, 'cause you're not here to tell me I can't
And girl, I wish I could say whiskey helps to drown the pain
But it only helps to drive me insane
Every time I hear your name

Baby, I bet you're happy now
Probably found you someone new
Who's got his life all figured out
As for me, I stay locked up in this old bedroom
Writing songs for you and thinking about us
Girl, I thought it was love

Went to bed with a headache tonight
'Cause I've got a mortgage due
And no one laying by my side
I never knew a king size bed would get so cold
When the king is down and he is all alone
Lord knows, I need a queen to hold

And baby, I bet you're happy now
Probably found you someone new
Who's got his life all figured out
As for me, I stay locked up in this old bedroom
Writing songs for you and thinking about us
Girl, I thought it was love

Girl, I knew it was love
I guess I didn't know what love was"

All our clothes scattered on the floor
Do not disturb sign posted on the door
Broken hearts and Calvin Klein are all indicators
Of a good time the night before
Both said that we would give it time
Cuervo has a way of cloudin’ minds
It wasn’t supposed to go this way
And you can’t chase this kind of pain
With a slice of lime

I’m tired of drunk love
You can only feel the lust when your body’s numb
Another one leads to keepin’ the lights on
Clothes off, decisions you regret
When the sun comes up
Cause it’s nothin’ to speak of
I’m tired of drunk love

It was supposed to be a means to an end
Candles burnin’, rose petals on the bed
Instead, it was the smell of cigarettes
We’re out too many, left a bad taste on my breath

I’m tired of drunk love
You can only feel the lust when your body’s numb
Another one leads to keepin’ the lights on
Clothes off, decisions you regret
When the sun comes up
Cause it’s nothin’ to speak of
I’m tired of drunk love

I’m tired of drunk love
You can only feel the lust when your body’s numb
Another one leads to keepin’ the lights on

Topped off that two-tone tank at the Texaco
Before she hits the road

Pissed off enough to pick herself up a pack of smokes

Flip a quarter, roll the dice

One's goin' my way
And one's hell on a highway

Tread left on forgiveness

That last goodbye cloud of dust it's gonna give me
Or does she miss mе?

And I know Detroit
Done boltеd down and don't mess around underneath that hood
And them horses are running good
So the only thing that's breakin' down
Is maybe that girl's breakin' down
Behind the wheel and I'm breakin' down the odds tonight

Some girls like roses and a man sayin' sorry by the dozen
To heal the heartbreak up, and
Some girls like a letter on a windshield, pourin' out his feelings
When it's all hit the ceilin'
But I know something even better I could try, so
I'm out here soakin' up your porch light glow
With an apology in my left hand
Hope it tastes like a second chance

'Cause I'm here to say sorry with a to-the-top glass of that Napa Valley vine Cabernet

So, let's get to thе bottom of these problems and this bottle before that moonlight quits
And turn this wine into water under the bridge

A little olive branch romance, drink it off our minds
'Til that twenty minute fight's ancient history
Baby, I just hope you'll forgive me
I'm tipsy, come kiss me, by the time it's empty

'Cause I'm here to say sorry with a to-the-top glass of that Napa Valley vine Cabernet
Girl, I couldn't go to bed, let another second pass without you and me being okay
So, let's get to the bottom of these problems and this bottle before that moonlight quits
And turn this wine into water under the bridge


And I know
Girl, I'm probably walkin' on a tightrope
But I can see you holdin' back a smile, so
What you say we don't stop 'til we get to the last drop?

'Cause I'm here to say sorry with a to-the-top glass of that Napa Valley vine Cabernet

She had two beers on the counter when I found her
That neon wrapped right around her like a smokey halo
We talked for almost an hour over sours
I told the girl, ""Tell me how you're in this bar all alone?""
She said she was meetin' someone, seein' someone
But all I know is he didn't show when

She let me buy her a drink
She even stole a sip of mine
She drug me front of the stage
Danced on my boots 'til closin' time
I got her numbеr and name
I ain't sayin' her and her mans got any plans on brеakin' up
But I'll tell you what
She's a little more single than she was
She's a little more single than she was

I bet he'll blame all the traffic
Tell her he got distracted
But I'll tell you right now that gal's body was actin'
Like she was missin' somethin'
Like he just isn't someone that learned from the last time
Maybe that's why

She let me buy her a drink
She even stole a sip of mine
She drug me front of the stage
Danced on my boots 'til closin' time
I got her number and name
I ain't sayin' her and her mans got any plans on breakin' up
But I'll tell you what

She could be leadin' me on
Be happy at home
But that look in her eyes looks like she's already gone

Tell your friends, you'll be just fine without me
But I'll be there in your mind when you fall asleep
Bet you dream, I bet you dream about
Me and you makin' out in the driveway
Now it's all rearview, behind me
And baby, somehow, we got sideways
So before I hit that highway

In the back of a bar all summer
Forgetting names like background noise
In relationships I wanted none of
Went off the rails by fall

Wore off the alcohol
And you were there like an angel waiting

Like to pray to Jesus
Spending Friday nights at home
Didn't know you'd be the strong kind
Deeper than a coal mine
Lovin' with a heart of gold
And you're everything that I'm not
Everything that I want
Thеre's a God and baby you're proof
In those brown еyes
I know that I gotta find a better me for you

Made a living dipping toes in the water
Feelin' low with my walls up high
I was staying far away from the deep end
Girl like you made a boy like me try
Went off the rails that fall
Lord knows I needed savin'
Made me forget them all

And I didn't know you'd have brown eyes

One day I'm gonna drive up there
And give them half my mind

Don't know why, but every time I cross that river
Lord, there's somethin' tears me up, makes me wild

Bloodshot eyes and skin so fair
I believe if I could find my keys

Go ahead and take her

Well he takes off his wedding ring
And she's taking off her top
And he did that dirty thing with her
But the worst part of the job
Is in the back of her mind there's a house with a wife and she's tucking kids to sleep
While she's breaking up a home that she wanted all along for her and now we're in the sheets

And he puts on his wedding ring
And she's putting on her clothes
And he did that dirty thing with her
But she already knows that it's all over
He ain't gonna leave what he's got at home
So she cries herself to sleep at night in a bedroom all alone

You can find her on the corner
Trying to make a little bit of cash
And she'll be your honey in a room for the money
She's just trying to make it past
She wishes she could go back
Wishes she could go back to the day she had a dream with a dress so she didn't have wear them fishnets on her legs
Oh every day

Well you see straight through her like a screen door
And the life she wants to live
And this world of sin she's been livin' in ain't the look she wants to give

You can find her on the corner
Trying to make a little bit of cash
And she'll be your honey in a room for the money
She's just trying to make it past
She wishes she could go back
Wishes she could go back to the day she had a dream with a dress so she didn't have wear them fishnets on her legs
Find her on the corner
You can find her on the corner
You can find her on the corner"

There's a letter to your mother that is hidden in my desk
That I wrote to her in a sober mind
It's my apology for all the things I used to be
Swearin' I'll change over time
She might not believe me 'cause no one ever does
Except her daughter that loves me true
God forbid all it takes for a boy to finally wake
Is to be cherished and loved all the way through

She lets me drink my liquor when I'm singin' through the night
She slaps my hand when it's too much
She's mean and she's kind, strong and divine
And Lord only knows how tough

So, dear Miss, by the time you see this
It'll be in love or it'll be in pain
May God bless and keep us
May you think kind of my name

And I know I've had my days and I made my mistakes
So please point me to the nearest perfect man
I'll gladly take advice from a man with no vice
If it means I can hold your hand

She was raised up proper and I was raised up
With a poor working boy's heart
The way the light is beatin' on her smilin' cheeks this evenin'
Is the finest of the world's fine art

So, dear Miss, by the time you see this
I'll be in love or it'll be in vain
So may God bless and keep us
May you think kind of my name

And she's standin' in the doorway ramblin' on about my old ways
How they were reckless and free
How all my imperfections and every ugly lesson
Is worth every last second with me"

Give me two more hours and I'll head downstairs

And summer was fine, I'll see you in New Year's Eve
Come back to bed 'fore you up and leave

But you play it cool under cold sheets
Even though that he said he'd
Let you know when he got home
Where's he at? Girl, you don't know
You're scared he'll think that you're crazy
So you drown in the what-ifs and maybes

Maybe, baby, he ain't the one
And maybe, baby, you need someone

That's gonna say a place and time
And then show up a little early
Gonna give you all his heart
A little more when you're feelin' lonely
You won't have to ask him if he loves you
The right onе'll come along and show you
It ain't always gotta be lightnin' and thunder
Hе won't make you wonder

You take him back
'Cause he said he's done actin' like that
He always says what you're needin'
Just to keep you from leavin'
Even though, deep down you know
He ain't the one, but you can't let him go
You're scared to start it all over
You'd rather flashback to mid October

Maybe, baby, he ain't the one
And maybe, baby, you need someone

That's gonna say a place and time
And then show up a little early
Gonna give you all his heart
A little more when you're feelin' lonely

You shouldn't have to wonder

He won't make you wonder
And, honey, I know you do
I drove down the same old road
'Til I stopped to find somebody new

He says a place and a time
And then shows up a little early
He gives me all his heart
Even more when I'm feelin' lonely
I never ask him if he loves me
The right one came along and showed me

Now I've grown up you'd think things have changed
Hurts me just as much to say they're the same

Mama, I lied he ain't a good guy
He makes me cry sometimes out of the blue

I was afraid of what you'd say to do
Guess I wasn't ready yet to hear the hard truth
So, Mama, I lied

I'd wipe the tears as quick as they'd fall
Say everything's fine every time that you'd call
And I'd swear he's perfect hopin' you couldn't tell
He was stealin' my spark walkin' me straight through hell

I was afraid of what you'd say to do

You said when somebody shows you who they really are
You better believe 'em
So I painted him the only way I thought you and I
Would wanna see him

He makes me cry sometimes out of the blue

Thank God she had the time to squeeze me in
My blonde was getting brassy, my roots were coming in
I let her do the talkin', let her spill the tea
I pay for the color but the drama's free
It's usually nothin' special, nothin' concerning me

Well, Casey's having a baby
The high school football team won state
And my best friend's mama's husband is sleeping around
Everybody's up to something
I heard your name from three chairs down
They said you bought a ring and you found the one
Now I'm heartbroke, heartbroken in a hair salon

I'm lookin' out the window hoping they don't see
The tear in my eye, I can hardly breathe
In the last place I thought you'd ever get to me
Pretend I'm listenin' as she goes on and on
Don't care who's selling weed to the preacher's son
I'm stuck on how you moved on
Guess it's a damn good day to go blonde

'Cause Casey's having a baby

And my best friend's mama's husband is sleeping around
Everybody's up to something
I heard your name from three chairs down
They said you bought a ring and you found the one
Now I'm heartbroke, heartbroken in a hair salon

Maybe I'm just crazy for thinking you'd come back around
I guess first loves don't always work out

But at least Casey's having a baby
The high school football team won state
And it's always happy hour at the bar downtown
I might just drink 'til I feel nothin'
I heard your name from three chairs down
They said you bought a ring and you found the one
Never thought I'd be, heartbroken in a hair salon
Heartbroken in a hair salon

In a house on a hill between the peaches and the pines
My daddy looked at me he said, ""Tough girls don't cry
And if it hurts put some dirt on it, but don't let a man bring you down""
So when you did what you did I knew what to do
You are who you are I know you're not used to this side of goodbye
It's always the other way around

Hell, I feel for 'em all, but I figured you out and you can't wreck my world
Guess you forgot, boy, I'm a Georgia girl

I packed your bags, gеt gone with the wind
It's your loss, not mine don't call mе again
And don't tell me you'll change, 'cause frankly, I don't give a damn

Louisiana let you lie and 'Bama took you back
You were two-timin' Tennessee, she forgave you like that
Oklahoma ain't over you and California calls when she's drunk and alone
Hell, I feel for 'em all, but I figured you out and you can't wreck my world

You can roll coast to coast
But don't be surprised
If you never get Georgia off your mind

They know what I'm thinkin’ by the look on my face
When I'm out of words they know just what to say
The first call I make when it all goes to hell
'Cause we’ve been there and back and don't go by ourselves

God bless the girls
Who bring home the wine
When you need a friend, no, they don't think twice
They let you go on for the ten-thousandth time
And tell the same stories about the same guy
They're easy to keep
And harder to find
God bless thе girls
And thank God for mine

When we drеss up, yeah, we sure draw a crowd
But we can throw down cabernet on the couch
Where we left off is right where we pick up
And if one of us don't like you then nobody does

God bless the girls

When you need a friend, no, they don't think twice
They let you go on for the ten-thousandth time
And tell the same stories about the same guy

And harder to find

And thank God for mine

They'll be right beside me the day I wear white
And I know they got me till the day that I die

Twenty-eighth of June, it was me and you
Rose petals on the bed, and I love you
Written on a happy 1-year card
""Here's to forever, you have my heart""
Drank a bottle of red and opened up another
Danced around the room, holdin' onto each other
Like we were never gonna let go
I was too naïve to know

Just 'cause something's good don't mean it lasts
By fall, we fell apart, and just like that
Time kept tickin', and you movеd on
Another 365 have come and gonе
Today would've been a day that we'd celebrate
And now it's just another Tuesday

Twenty-eighth of June, callin' out of work
Wakin' up alone, sleepin' in your shirt
Wonderin' if you think about me
Are you really already happy?
Come on, babe, don't say it's true
That she loves you like I still do
Say I still cross your mind
And it's eating you alive

Just 'cause something's good don't mean it lasts
By fall, we fell apart, and just like that
Time kept tickin', and you moved on
Another 365 have come and gone
Today would've been a day that we'd celebrate
And now it's just another Tuesday

The twenty-eighth of June will come one day
I'll wake up and be okay
But the rain outside says, ""It won't be today""

But the way he kissed me goodnight
Made me never wanna say goodbye

Maybe he'll show up with his grandma's ring
'Til then I'll be spendin' time namin' our dogs and babies

I called his momma
I got her number off his phone while he was sleepin'

Underneath the Under Armour, found a letter
Hmm, who's Heather?

Got the whole thing planned in a board on Pinterest (Oh, that is so cute)
Heard he's got a little bit of family money (Yeah he does)
Trust me, didn't know he had a trust fund, honey
I can't wait for our second date (Oh, I can't wait)
Maybe he'll show up with his grandma's ring (To get his grandma's ring)
'Til then I'll be spendin' time namin' our dogs and babies (I hope they look like him, ooh)

I was thinking Ella Grace and Jimmy James
How about Scout and Sady?
You know, nothin' crazy"
