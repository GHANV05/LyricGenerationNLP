I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love, but
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Oh-oh

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?"

When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love


The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love"

Son of a gun

You walked into the party like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror, as you watched yourself gavotte

And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner
They'd be your partner and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you?

You had me several years ago when I was still quite naive
Well, you said that we made such a pretty pair and that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me

I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you? Don't you?


I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you?

Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga
And your horse naturally won
Then you flew your Learjet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun
Well, you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not

You're with some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
Wife of a close friend and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you? Don't you now?

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you"

Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blonde tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot a whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know

Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats

I was cheated by you
And I think you know when

But I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look
And I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, w-o-o-o-o-h

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist ya?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed ya
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I should not have let you go

I was angry and sad
'Bout the things that you do
I can't count all the times that I cried over you

And when you go
When you slam the door
I think you know
That you won’t be away too long
You know that I’m not that strong
Just one look
And I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, w-o-o-o-oh

You're insecure, don't know what for

Don't need makeup to cover up (Huh)
Bein' the way that you are is enough

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful

So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else ('Body else)
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell

Sometimes might knock me down, but

And I, I gotta be strong

Mm, too young, too dumb to realize

That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man

Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)

That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours

Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance

But she's dancin' with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that

Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everythin' that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know

And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""

Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song

Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know

Entonces escuché que estabas hablando basura
Estoy en un misterio
Abrázame, que estoy a punto de estallar

Si, ahora estoy a cuatro, cinco segundos de explotar
Y tenemos tres días más hasta el Viernes
Solo estoy tratando de regresar a casa el Lunes por la mañana
Te juro que desearía que alguien me lo dijera
Oh, eso es todo lo que quiero

Y sé que estás despierto esta noche
Pensando, ""¿Cómo pude ser tan egoísta?""
Pero me llamaste mil veces
Preguntándome dónde he estado
Ahora sé que estás despierto esta noche
Pensando, ""¿Cómo pude ser tan imprudente?""
Pero no puedo disculparme
Espero que lo puedas entender, sí

Si voy a la cárcel esta noche
Prométeme que pagarás mi fianza
Mira que ellos quieren comprar mi orgullo
Pero eso no está a la venta
Mira toda mi amabilidad (Mhm)
Ser tomada por debilidad

Ahora estoy a cuatro, cinco segundos de explotar
Y tenemos tres días más hasta el Viernes
Solo estoy tratando de regresar a casa el Lunes por la mañana
Te juro que desearía que alguien me lo dijera
Oh, eso es todo lo que quiero
Estoy a cuatro, cinco segundos de explotar
Y tenemos tres días más hasta el Viernes
Solo estoy tratando de regresar a casa el Lunes por la mañana
Te juro que desearía que alguien me lo dijera
Porque eso es todo lo que quiero"

It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two, twenty-two

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleeping

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

(Hey!) I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh), twenty-two (I don't know about you)
Twenty-two, twenty-two (Ooh)

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleepin'
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you (You)

Young man, there's no need to feel down, I said
Young man, pick yourself off the ground, I said
Young man, 'cause you're in a new town
There's no need to be unhappy
Young man, there's a place you can go, I said
Young man, when you're short on your dough you can
Stay there and I'm sure you will find
Many ways to have a good time

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

You can hang out with all the boys

You can do whatever you feel

Young man, I was once in your shoes, I said
I was down and out with the blues, I felt
No man cared if I were alive
I felt the whole world was so jive
That's when someone came up to me and said
""Young man, take a walk up the street
It's a place there called the Y.M.C.A. 
They can start you back on your way""

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight, you look so pretty
Yes, you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me, what you do to me

Hey there, Delilah, I know times are gettin' hard
But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes, and trains, and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there, Delilah, you be good, and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school, and I'll be making history
Like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me, what you do to me

She's just a girl and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy
Lonely like a highway
She's livin' in a world and it's on fire
Filled with catastrophe
But she knows she can fly away

Oh-oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burnin' it down
Oh-oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backin' down

This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walkin' on fire
This girl is on fire

Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try, but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls, say

Oh-oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burnin' it down
Oh-oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not comin' down

This girl is on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walkin' on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire

(Oh) Everybody stares as she goes by
'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lightin' up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby

This girl is on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walkin' on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire

The pen's in my hand
Ending: unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten

Yeah
Oh, oh

I break tradition
Sometimes my tries
Are outside the lines, yeah, yeah
We've been conditioned
To not make mistakes
But I can't live that way, no, oh

Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find

It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if ya did
And all the science, I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week

It's wanting what you've got

I'm gonna soak up the sun

I've got a crummy job
It don't pay near enough
To buy the things it'd take
To win me some of your love

Every time I turn around
I'm lookin' up, you're lookin' down
Maybe something's wrong with you
That makes you act the way you do

I'm, I'm gonna soak up the sun
I'm gonna tell everyone to lighten up

I'm gonna soak up the sun
While it's still free
I'm gonna soak up the sun
Before it goes out on me

Don't have no master suite
But I'm still the king of me
You have a fancy ride, but baby
I'm the one who has the key

Every time I turn around
I'm lookin' up, you're lookin' down
Maybe something's wrong with you
That makes you act the way you do
Maybe I am crazy too

Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes, we've got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change
The more they stay the same
Ooh, don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Got to love that afro hairdo

Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same
The more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song (Yeah!)
You go ahead, let your hair down (Girl)
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

'Twas more than I could take
Pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake
I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize
That you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song (Baby, ooh!)

Bir gün, bir gün
Bir gün yıldızlı bir taç takmak istiyorum

Bir gün, bir gün, bir gün
Uzanmak istiyorum, Pazar günü, tanrının yaptığı gibi
Bekle, bekle
Bazı günler, bazı günler bu Pazar günü hatırladığım günler
Geri yol, evet, yollar, yollar, yanıyorlar
Bir gün, herkese anlatmak istiyorum
Kırmızı noktadan vurmak istiyorum
Bazı günler
Şimdi kafam güzel yaşıyorum, marijuana içiyorum
Şimdi kafam güzel yaşıyorum, ne istersem yapıyorum

Beni sevmeni sağlamaya çalışıyordum
Ama denediğim her şey, seni benden uzaklaştırıyor

Bir gün hepsini geride bırakacağız
Bir gün bunların hepsini aşacağız
Bebeğim, hepsini ortaya koymak
Bir paket Fentanyl
Seni silip attıklarını düşünebilirsin
Beni asmak zorunda kalabilirler
Bir gün drama bitecek
Ve dua edecekler, ama yetmeyecek
Bazen her şey bana parlıyor
Bütün şarabı içmişim gibi konuşuyorsun
Yıllar var önümüzde, ama hepsi gerideler
Bir, iki, üç, dört, beş tane
Sahte doğrular yok, bütün fikirler çıplak
Uzay ve zaman arasında kaldım
Aklımızda olan bu değildi
Ama belki bir gün..

Beni sevmeni sağlamaya çalışıyordum
Ama denediğim her şey, seni benden uzaklaştırıyor

Woah, bir kere daha çocuk oldum
Bildiğim her şeyi bir kenara attım
Her şeyi, evet
Ve artık hiç bir şey acıtmıyor özgür hissediyorum
Biz hala o günkü çocuklarız, evet, evet
Elimi bir ocağa koydum, hala kanıyormuyum görmek için
Ve artık hiç bir şey acıtmıyor, özgür hissediyorum
Biz hala o günkü çocuklarız, evet, evet
Elimi bir ocağa koydum, hala kanıyormuyum görmek için

Yee-haw
Ooh
Texas, Texas (Ooh) Texas

Came into this world, daddy's little girl
And Daddy made a soldier out of me (Ooh)
Daddy made me dance and Daddy held my hand (Ooh)
And Daddy liked his whiskey with his tea

And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said, ""Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister""
And oh, that's when he gave to me

With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone, ""Here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around""
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Ooh
Yee, woo
Ooh
Yee-haw (Woo)

Daddy made me fight, it wasn't always right
But he said, ""Girl, it's your second amendment"" (Ooh)
He always played it cool, but Daddy was no fool
And right before he died, he said, ""Remember...""

He said, ""Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister""
That's when Daddy looked at me

With his gun, with his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot (Yee)
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Yee-haw)
'Cause he held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
And he told me when he's gone, ""Here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around""
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Woo)

Ooh (Woo)

He said, ""Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you"" (Ooh)

Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble, she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too, oh

Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back
Struck from a great height
By someone who should have known better than that

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name

Tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from nine to five

Workin' nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmm

They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the bossman's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way

Working nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
Nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it

And I wind up feelin' down

On a love that burns hot enough to last

La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

It took too long, it took too long, it took too long
For you to call back
And normally, I would just forget that
Except for the fact it was my birthday, my stupid birthday
I played along, I played along, I played along
Rolled right off my back
But obviously, my armor was cracked
What kind of a boyfriend would forget that?
Who would forget that?

The type of guy who doesn't see
What he has until she leaves
Don't let me go
'Cause without me, you know you're lost
Wise up now or pay the cost
Soon you will know

You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' with me
You're not winnin' 'til you're winnin'
Winnin' me
You're not gettin' 'til you're gettin'
Gettin' me
You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' for me

This is the potential breakup song
Our album needs just one
Oh, baby, please, please tell me

We got along, we got along, we got along
Until you did that
Now all I want is just my stuff back
Do you get that? Let me repeat that
I want my stuff back

You can send it in a box
I don't care, just drop it off
I won't be home
'Cause without me, you know you're lost
Minus you, I'm better off
Soon you will know

You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' with me
You're not winnin' 'til you're winnin'
Winnin' me
You're not gettin' 'til you're gettin'
Gettin' me
You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' for me

You can try, you can try
You know I know it'd be a lie
Without me, you're gonna die
So you better think clearly, clearly
Before you nearly, nearly mess up
A situation that you're gonna miss dearly, dearly, c'mon

You're not livin' 'til you're livin' (No)
Livin' with me
You're not winnin' 'til you're winnin' (No, no, no, no)
Winnin' me
You're not gettin' 'til you're gettin' ('Til you're gettin')
Gettin' me
You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' for me (No-no, no-no, no-no, no-no)

This is the potential breakup song
Our album needs just one
Oh, baby, please, please tell me
This is the potential make up song
Please just admit you're wrong
Which will it be?
Which will it be?

Yes, if I bought it, nigga, please don't touch (Don't touch)
And keep talkin' that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And, it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standin' in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was puttin' you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standin' in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you

So don't you ever for a second get to thinking

So since I'm not your everything (Irreplaceable)
How about I'll be nothing (Nothing)
Nothing at all to you (Nothing)
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you (I won't shed a tear)

I know I can't take one more step towards you
'Cause all that's waiting is regret
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore?
You lost the love I love the most

I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart?
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms

And I've learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart?
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

Dear, it took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
'Cause you broke all your promises
And now you're back
You don't get to get me back

And who do you think you are
Runnin' 'round leavin' scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart?
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Don't come back at all
And who do you think you are

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted, then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh-ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed

But you're just a boy"

My heart melted to the ground, found somethin' true
And everyone's lookin' 'round thinkin' I'm going crazy
Ooh, yeah

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth

Keep, keep bleeding love

Their piercin' sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from fallin', ooh, yeah
But nothin's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth

They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth

La, da, da, da

The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your hometown
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
Be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightening out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

The path that I'm walking, I must go alone
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full grown, full grown
Fairytales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightening out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Like the little schoolmate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and UNO cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be my Valentine
Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I wanna hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers
And share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late and dark outside
I need to be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity, yeah

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightening out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

A, amen
Amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny
Somethin' meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean

Oh, oh, amen
Amen, amen

I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
""You'll never reach it""
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost with no direction
My faith is shaken

But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments that
I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going

And I, I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on 'cause

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side

Head underwater and they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me, it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today
(Yeah) Today, yeah

I learned the hard way that they all say
Things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you
And your twisted words, your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry

Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today

Promise me
That you'll leave the light on
To help me see
With daylight, my guide, gone
'Cause I believe there's a way
You can love me because I say...

I won't write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (Ooh)
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this, huh
Is that why you wanted a love song? (Yeah)
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (Write you a love song)
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you (I want you) to stay
If your heart is nowhere in it, I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas (Walk the seven seas)

Can't count the years on one hand that we've been together
I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park to love each other
But when our fingers interlock, can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

'Cause after all this time
I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And, baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time
I'm still into you

Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house, I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song, we sang along to the start of forever

And after all this time
I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And, baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all

And one of those is you and I (Hey)
Some things just, some things just make sense

Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosin' and scrubbin' as best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store, too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, 'cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Lettin' each one burn, down to his thick fingers
Before blowin' and cursin' them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash, too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon, but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard"

I hate the world today
You're so good to me, I know, but I can't change
Tried to tell you but you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet

Yesterday I cried
You must have been relieved to see the softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

So take me as I am
This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change and today won't mean a thing

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

Just when you think you got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool, you do what you do
And don't try to save me

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt, when you suffer
I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb, I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive
You know I wouldn't want it any other way"

Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed, and it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?
This world is forcing me to hold your hand

'Cause I'm just a girl, oh, little old me
Well, don't let me out of your sight
Oh, I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights

Oh, I've had it up to here

The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear

'Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh, I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
Oh, I'm just a girl, take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype

Oh, I've had it up to here
Oh, am I making myself clear?

I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world
That's all that you'll let me be

Oh, I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
Oh, I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
Oh, I'm just a girl, lucky me
Twiddle-dum, there's no comparison

Oh, I've had it up to

Put her canine teeth in the side of my neck

I just want you to make a move
So slow down, sit down, it's new

I just wanna get to know ya
Guess I didn't quite think it through (Nah-uh, girl)
Fell in love with the thought of you
Now I'm choked up, face down, burnt out

Baby, why don't you come over?

Well, back at my house
I've got a California king
Okay, maybe it's a twin bed
And some roommates (Don't worry, we're cool)
I heard you like magic
I've got a wand and a rabbit
So baby, let's get freaky, get kinky
Let's make this bed get squeaky

All your expectations of my love are impossible
Surely, you know that I'm not easy to hold
It's so sad how incapable of learning to grow I am
My heart speaks in puzzle and codes
I've been trying my whole life to solve
God only knows how I've cried
I can't take another defeat
A next time would be the ending of me
Now that I see

That love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

How unbelievable (Unbelievable)
Of me to fall for the lies that I tell (Lies I tell)
The dream that I sell (Dream I sell)
When heartache, it's inevitable (And unbearable)
But I'm no good at doing it well
Not that I care (I don't care)
Why should anything about it be fair?

When love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

No amount of love
Can keep me satisfied (Satisfied, satisfied)
I can't keep up (Can't keep up, can't keep up)
When I keep changing my mind (Change my mind, change my mind)
The feelings flood me to the heights of no compromise

Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

Oh, you know I'd do it all again
I love it now like I loved it then
I'm a fool for them
You know I'm, you know I'm gonna do it, oh
I'll do it all again like I did then"

I know you wanted me to stay
But I can't ignore the crazy visions of me in L.A. 
And I heard that there's a special place
Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day

I'm having wicked dreams of leaving Tennessee
Hear Santa Monica, I swear it's calling me
Won't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby girl, I know she's gonna scream

""God, what have you done?
You're a pink pony girl, and you dance at the club,"" oh mama
I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels, it's where I belong, down at the

Pink Pony Club, I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club, I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
West Hollywood, I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club

I'm up and jaws are on the floor
Lovers in the bathroom and a line outside the door
Black lights and a mirrored disco ball
Every night's another reason why I left it all

I thank my wicked dreams, a year from Tennessee
Oh, Santa Monica, you've been too good to me
Won't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby girl, I know she's gonna scream

""God, what have you done?
You're a pink pony girl, and you dance at the club,"" oh mama

Don't think I've left you all behind
Still love you and Tennessee, you're always on my mind
And mama, every Saturday
I can hear your Southern drawl a thousand miles away, saying

""God, what have you done?

Sparks fly, it's like electricity
I might die, when I forget how to breathe
You get closer and there's nowhere
In this world I'd rather be
Time stops like everything around me is frozen
And nothing matters but these
Few moments when you open
My mind to things I've never seen

'Cause when I'm kissin' you, my senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle piece I've been tryna find
Falls right into place, you're all that it takes
My doubts fade away when I'm kissin' you
When I'm kissin' you, it all starts makin' sense
And all the questions I've been askin' in my head
Like, ""Are you the one? Should I really trust?""
Crystal clear, it becomes when I'm kissin' you

Past loves, they never got very far
Walls up, make sure I guarded my heart
And I promised I wouldn't do this
'Til I knew it was right for me
But no one (No one)
No guy that I've met before
Could make me (Make me) feel so right and secure
And have you noticed? I lose my focus
And the world around me disappears

'Cause when I'm kissin' you, my senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle piece I've been tryna find
Falls right into place, you're all that it takes
My doubts fade away when I'm kissin' you
When I'm kissin' you, it all starts makin' sense
And all the questions I've been askin' in my head
Like, ""Are you the one? Should I really trust?""
Crystal clear, it becomes when I'm kissin' you

I've never felt nothing like this
You're making me open up
No point even tryin' to fight this
It kinda feels like it's love

'Cause when I'm kissin' you, my senses come alive (Come alive)
Almost like the puzzle piece I've been tryna find
Falls right into place, you're all that it takes
My doubts fade away when I'm kissin' you
When I'm kissin' you, it all starts makin' sense (Makin' sense)
And all the questions I've been askin' in my head

Crystal clear, it becomes when I'm kissin' you"

Lindas garotas em todo o mundo, eu podia seguir
Mas meu tempo seria desperdiçado
Elas não são nada comparadas à você, amor
Nada contra você, amor
Elas podem dizer ""Oi"", e eu poderia dizer ""Olá""
Mas você não deve se preocupar, com o que dizem
Porque elas não são nada contra você, amor (Sim)
Nada contra você, amor
Na-na-na nada contra você, amor, na-nada contra você, ha
Sim

Eu sei que você sente de onde eu venho (De)
Independentemente do que fiz no meu passado (Fiz)
A maioria foi realmente só por pura diversão (Diversão)
Em um carrossel, só fiquei girando (Girando)
Sem direção, apenas tentando ganhar alguma coisa (Alguma?)
Indo atrás de saias, vivendo sob o sol do verão (Sol)
E assim eu perdi mais do que eu já tinha ganhado (Ganhado)
E honestamente, eu acabei sem nada (Hein?)

É tamanho absurdo, está na minha consciência
Estou pensando ""talvez eu devesse tirar""
E eu não quero soar redundante, mas eu estava pensando
Se houvesse algo que você queira saber (Que você queira saber)
Mas não importa, devemos deixar para lá (Devemos deixar para lá)
Porque nós não queremos ser um episódio de TV (Episódio de TV)
E todos os maus pensamentos, deixem para lá (Lá, lá, lá, lá, hein)

Lindas garotas em todo o mundo, eu podia seguir
Mas meu tempo seria desperdiçado
Elas não são nada comparadas à você, amor
Nada contra você, amor
Elas podem dizer ""Oi"", e eu poderia dizer ""Olá""
Mas você não deve se preocupar, com o que dizem
Porque elas não são nada contra você, amor (Sim)
Nada contra você, amor
Na-na-na nada contra você, amor, na-nada contra você, ha
Sim

Mãos para baixo, nunca haverá outra (não)
Eu estive andando por aí, e eu nunca vi outra
(nunca)
Porque o seu estilo, eu realmente não sou nada perto
(nada)
E você fica selvagem quando não veste nada (Haha)
Baby você é o pacote completo
Além disso, você paga seus impostos
E você fica na real, enquanto as outras só fantasiam
Minha Mulher Maravilha, me chame de Sr. Fantástico
Pare, agora pense nisso

Eu fui para Londres, eu fui a Paris
Fui até bem longe, Tóquio
De volta para casa, na Geórgia, em Nova Orleans
Mas você sempre rouba a cena
E assim como essa menina, você me paralisou
Como um de Nintendo 64
Se você nunca soube bem, agora você sabe, sabe


Aonde quer que eu vá, sempre ouço o seu nome
E não importa onde eu estou, menina você me faz querer
Cantar
Quer seja um ônibus, avião, carro ou trem
Não penso em mais ninguém, você é a única a ser culpada


Sim
E é assim que fazemos
E eu vou só deixar esse passeio
