Morgan Wallen (ترجمه‌ی فارسی) Lyrics
2 AM at a Broadway bar
ساعت 2 بامداد تو یه بار تو خیابون برادوی
She's puttin' her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
شماره اش رو میزنه تو گوشیم (دخترای تنهای اهل برادوی)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don't mean
دوتا بطری آبجو بادلایت تا آخر خورده شده،  و چیزایی میگه که منظوری نداره
And you know
و میدونی که

I met her down at Aldean's
تو رستوان بار ""اَلدنز نشویل"" دیدمش
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
گفت که حدود یک مایل دورتر من رو در حال قدم زدن دید
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
پسر خاله ام ""بین"" فقط میخواست تلفنش رو ازش بگیره (تا ازم فیلم نگیره) و همین لبخندش رو از بین بر
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
گفت زیادی مست و دیوونه ام، نحوه رقصیدنم رو دوست نداره
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
گفتم: مجبور نیستی بهم ملحق بشی. گفت شانسشو امتحان میکنه
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
از وقتی که نقشه ام شکست خورد یه جورایی دیوونه بودم
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
یه جورایی گم شدم، و این چیزی بود که فهمیدم
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around
دخترای مثل تو فقط میخوان من رو دور بزنن، دور بزنن، دور بزنن

Oh, there's two things that you'rе gonna find out
اوه، دوتا چیز هست که قراره بفهمی
They don't love you and they only lovе you right now
اونا عاشقت نیستن و فقط همین الان دوستت دارن
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
اگه زرنگ بودم، میموندم خونه
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
و دخترای اهل برادوی رو تنها میذاشتم (تنهاشون میذاشتم، تنهاشون میذاشتم)
Them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
دخترای تنهای اهل برادوی (تنهاشون میذاشتم، تنهاشون میذاشتم)
Leave them Broadway girls alone
دخترای اهل برادوی رو تنها میذاشتم

They town just told me, ""Don't trust 'em""
اهالی شهرشون بهم گفتن: بهشون (به دخترای برادوی) اعتماد نکن
Broadway girls a trap
دختر اهل برادوی یه تله است
They on me, they tryna finesse me
مهمون منن، سعی میکنن زرنگی کنن
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
منو با ""مرگان"" دیدن و میدونن رپ میکنم
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
اسب من (ماشینم) پورشه، بهم توجه میکنن
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
پریدم رو یه اسب، اونم نشست پشتم
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
رفتم بار تا واسش یه نوشیدنی بگیرم
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
بهم گفت رپ دوست نداره، آهنگ های ""پینک"" رو گوش میده
I can't run out of money
نمیتونم بی پول بشم (معنی دوم: نمیتونم بدون پول ادامه بدم)
The trenches love me forever
محله های فقیرو خلافکار همیشه دوستم دارن
They treat me like Ed in London
مثل ""اد شیرن"" تو لندن باهام رفتار میکنن
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
بردمش استخر، بعدش رایگان یه آبجو گرفتم
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
بوت های ""تیکوواس""، گیتار، سیگار، بار مشروب
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars
مثل ماشین ها سوار گاو نر میشه، معمولا با آدم معروفا خوب نیس

Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out
حالا، دوتا چیز هست که قراره بفهمی
They don't love you and they only love you right now
اونا عاشقت نیستن و فقط همین الان دوستت دارن
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
اگه زرنگ بودم، میموندم خونه
And leave them Broadway girls alone
و دخترای اهل برادوی رو تنها میذاشتم
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
دخترای اهل برادوی، دخترای اهل برادوی
Them Broadway girls alone
دخترای تنهای اهل برادوی
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
دخترای اهل برادوی، دخترای اهل برادوی
Them Broadway girls alone
دخترای تنهای اهل برادوی

Oh, think I oughta settle down
اوه، فکر کنم باید به اینن وضع عادت کنم
And find me somethin' I can take back to my hometown, oh
و یه چیزی پیدا کنم تا بتونم باهاش برگردم به شهر خودم، اوه
But I told 'em that I'm savage
ولی بهشون گفتم که من رام نمیشم
They just tryna tell me there's
اونا فقط میخواستن بهم بگن:

There's two things that you're gonna find out
دوتا چیز هست که قراره بفهمی
They don't love you and they only love you right now
اونا عاشقت نیستن و فقط همین الان دوستت دارن
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home

And leave them Broadway girls alone
و دخترای اهل برادوی رو تنها میذاشتم

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

The only poison I've had is ivy
The only man I fear is God
No snakes can make me run now
'Cause I've been bit by 'em all
No buck can stare me down
No neighbor can shut me up
I'm off the grid and I'm off my rocker
I'm off in the holler, son

We them holler boys
Holler if you're needin' somethin' done
Holler if you need a chip on a shoulder
And a hand with a loaded gun
We'll be out that screen door, no shirt on
Leavin' two black marks down a one-lane road
Yeah we, yeah we
Yeah, we them holler boys

The only fight I've ever been in
Was takin' up for somebody else
The only time I got my jaw jacked is never
But damn sure not quite yet
The times I miss the most
Are the times nobody knows
When it was me, my cousin, and a couple of my buddies
Racin' down ol' Sams Creek Road

We them holler boys
Holler if you're needin' somethin' done
Holler if you need a chip on a shoulder
And a hand with a loaded gun
We'll be out that screen door, no shirt on
Leavin' two black marks down a one-lane road
Yeah we, yeah we
Yeah we them holler boys

Holler boy, native to the holler soil
Washed in the spring of a farmer's joy
We them holler boys
Holler if you're needin' somethin' done
Holler if you need a chip on a shoulder
Or a hand with a loaded gun

We them holler boys
Holler if you're needin' somethin' done
Holler if you need a chip or a shoulder
And a hand with a loaded gun
We'll be out that screen door, no shirt on
Leavin' two black marks down a one-lane road
Yeah we, yeah we
Yeah, we them holler boys"

Oh, oh-oh

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more (Kio, Kio)
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached

Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more"

Yeah D. Thrash
Yeah all the girls wanna ride with me
Yeah all the girls wanna ride with me
Yeah they say they like my truck (my truck my truck my truck)

All the girls wanna ride and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck, get stuck wanna ride
Let your hair down, said you want a redneck, don't be scared now
All the girls wanna ride and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck, get stuck wanna ride
Let your hair down, said you want a redneck, don't be scared now

My 49's diggin', lip full of dip
Winch on the front 'cause my truck's well-equipped
I'm in the parkin' lot, I'm pimpin' with my Wranglers on
Leanin' on the truck, I'll make them girls wanna moan
My jeans tight and I know I'm lookin' right
Got so many girls lookin', they about to start a fight
Look I'm tryna have some fun when I hop in the truck
You wanna roll, sit down, hold on, and shut up
12 gauge on the back glass ready to go
I never know when I'm gonna see a buck or a doe
And if I see a cop, girl I ain't worried
A po-po in the mud hole'll get buried
See the is what they make these big tires for
Want more, I'mma put the pedal down to the floor
And take you to a place you ain't never been out in the country
I bet I'll have you sayin' you love me

All the girls wanna ride and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck, get stuck wanna ride
Let your hair down, said you want a redneck, don't be scared now
All the girls wanna ride and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck, get stuck wanna ride
Let your hair down, said you want a redneck, don't be scared now

And you know I'm from the hunch bunch, moonshine in my cup
In the truck, gettin' stuck in the mud, windows rolled up
All four wheels diggin' this ain't the game
You havin' fun, ain't ya girl, bet you glad that you came
Black powder coated wheels, Mickey Thompson on the tires
They said 49's wouldn't fit, but they liars
We can take a trip to the store and back
You say you want a six pack, we need more than that
What you waitin' on girl, this the chance of your life
There ain't nothin' the them city boys got that you like
If you don't know what you missin' just quit talkin' and listen
I can drive over cars while they right there sittin'
Think about it for a minute 'til I leave in my truck
Then you see your best friend askin', ""How do I get up?""
If you country and you love it, then you can relate
But those city boys sure gon' hate

All the girls wanna ride and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck, get stuck wanna ride
Let your hair down, said you want a redneck, don't be scared now
All the girls wanna ride and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck, get stuck wanna ride
Let your hair down, said you want a redneck, don't be scared now

Haha, yeah
Y'all know

Yeah all the girls wanna ride with me

My baby want a Birkin, she's been tellin' me all night long
Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on
This nine-to-five ain't workin', why the hell do I work so hard?
I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone, uh

One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round,"" we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord

Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey
They know me and Jack Daniеl's got a history
There's a party downtown near 5th Street
Evеrybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

I've been Boozey since I left
I ain't changin' for a check
Tell my ma I ain't forget (Oh, Lord), I
Woke up drunk at 10 a.m.​
We gon' do this shit again
Tell your girl to bring a friend, oh, Lord

One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round,"" we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord

Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (Double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (We go way back)
There's a party downtown near 5th Street

One, here comes the two to the three to the four
When it's last call and they kick us out the door
It's gettin' kind of late, but the ladies want some more
Oh my, good Lord (Tell 'em drinks on me)

Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (Double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (Way back)
There's a party downtown near 5th Street (Come on)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (Woo-ooh)
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (Double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (It's Jack D)
At the bottom of a bottle, don't miss me (Baby, don't miss me)

Cowboy
Cowboy

Well I'm packin' up my game and I'ma head out west
Where real women come equipped with scripts and fake breasts
Find a nest in the Hills, chill like Flynt
Buy an old drop-top find a spot to pimp
And I'ma Kid Rock it up and down ya' block
With a bottle of scotch and watch lots a crotch
Buy a yacht with a flag sayin' ""Chillin' the Most""
Then rock that bitch up and down the coast
Give a toast to the sun, drink with the stars
Get thrown in the mix and tossed outta bars
Sip the Tiajuana, I want to roam
Find Motown, tell them fools to come back home
Start an escort service for all the right reasons
And set up shop at the top of Four Seasons
Kid Rock and I'm the real McCoy
And I'm headed out west sucker because I wanna be a

Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby!
West Coast chillin' with the Boone's wine
I wanna be a Cowboy, baby!
Ridein' at night 'cause I sleep all day!
Cowboy, baby!
I can smell a pig from a mile away

I bet you'll hear my whistle blowin' when my train rolls in
It goes (whistling), like dust in the wind
Stoned pimp, stoned freak, stoned out of my mind
I once was lost but now I'm just blind
Palm trees and weeds, scabbed knees and rice
Get a map to the stars, find Heidi Fleiss
And if the price is right then I'm gonna make my bid boy
And let Cali-for-ni-a know why they call me

Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby!
West Coast chillin' with the Boone's wine
I wanna be a Cowboy, baby!
Ridein' at night 'cause I sleep all day!
Cowboy, baby!
I can smell a pig from a mile away

Yeah!
Kid Rock you can call me Tex
Rollin' Sunset woman with a bottle of Beck's
Seen a slimmy in a 'Vette, rolled down my glass
And said ""Yeah this dick fits right in your ass""
No kiddin', gun slingin', spurs hittin' the floor
Call me hoss, I'm the boss with the sauce and the whores
No remorse for the sheriff, in his eye I ain't right
I'ma paint his town red, then paint his wife white
Cause chaos, rock like Amadeus
Find West Coast pussy for my Detroit playas
Mack like mayors, ball like Lakers
They told us to leave, but bet they can't make us
Why they wanna pick on me
Lock me up and snort away my key
I ain't no G, I'm just a regular failure
I ain't straight outta Compton, I'm straight out the trailer
Cuss like a sailor, drink like a mick
My only words of wisdom are just suck my dick
I'm flickin' my Bic up and down that coast and
Keep on truckin' till I fall in the ocean

Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby!
Spend all my time in Hollywood and Vine
Cowboy, baby!
Ride at night 'cause I sleep all day!
Cowboy, baby!
I can smell a pig from a mile away
Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'

With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'

Said she likes cheap drinks and tattoos and Morgan Wallen
She said, ""What about you?"" I said, ""I like late night bonfires
Yellowstone, Whiskey Myers, and lifted trucks with mud on the tires
And I'm back

Feelin' like a million bucks
Still tryna live it up, live in America
Grew up in the Appalachian mountains
South of the Mason Dixon in a small-town area
Been tryna tell y'all for a minute that I'm here
I ain't goin' nowhere anytime soon
I'm in my hometown right now
With the windows down at the Cook Out drive-thru
Pull up, hop out, Walmart, late night
Redbox movie, you, me, date night
This that full moon risin'
Girl, I'm full of surprisеs
Camo pants with the Air Johns
I'm so stylish
Don't ask me for my opinion
I don't want y'all to get offеnded
Everybody's just so sensitive
It's so crazy, it's ruined so many friendships
Okay, I'ma come back later
Why would I care about my haters?
All I care about's my friends, my family, and my Lord and Savior
I'm back now on the track now
West Virginia's finally on the map now
I just do my thing, let my guitar sing, like
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Back in this thing like I never left, my flow is heaven-sent
I'm eatin' jerky, it's venison
I am pure excellence, I am the excrement
Everybody's in the room, I'm the elephant (Ayy)
Hoppin' in my truck, I'm comin'
Keep that engine runnin'
Just copped me a new chain with Yellowstones
I feel like John Dutton
Y'all boys lame like Jamie
Me? I'm more like Kayce
On these tracks, I'm Beth (Why?)
'Cause I go crazy
Yeah, I'm wild and free
Got riders with me
They call my boy Rip 'cause when you see him
It's R.I.P

Another shot, she'll love me again
(Run that back, Turbo)
Haha, make it a double

Whiskey, whiskey, won’t you go away?
Come again some other day
'Cause her memory came out to play
And I'm tired of it, tired of it
I don’t wanna wonder where she been (Where she at?)
She was here, now she gone again (Need her back)
Now it's me and all my whiskey friends
And I'm tired of it (Hey), tired of it (Yeah, speak)

Dark brown skin, caught eye contact while walkin' in (On the walk up)
Perfect timing, get beside me, now we lockin' in (Linked in)
She like, ""Tell me how you want it, on the rocks again (What else?)
Lil' salt around the rim (Okay), filled to the top again?"" (Let's go)
Fell back, now I'm back in it
Del Dia shots got me sinning
Big racks, but these jeans skinny
Plain Richard Mille square business (Boss)
See me in the club two-steppin’
Diamonds ’round my neck square-dancing
You done made a gangster romantic
Fiendin' for your love, I’m an addict (Ayy)
So addicted, ain't nothin' we can do about it (Nah)
Country motherfucker, I say, ""What's up?"" she say, ""Howdy"" (Howdy)
Call you my lil’ cowgirl how you ride it like a stallion (Uh, uh)
Don't know why I love it
Can't get tired of it (I'm on you bad)

Whiskey, whiskey, won't you go away?
Come again some other day
'Cause her memory came out to play
And I'm tired of it, tired of it
I don't wanna wonder where she been (Where she at?)
She was here, now she gone again (Need her back)
Now it's me and all my whiskey friends
And I'm tired of it, tired of it

Put you up and hide you on the shelf, I swear I'm through with you
You so hard to leave alone, it's always something new with you
Ain't no way to get her gone, gone, gone
So I guess I'm gonna tie one on
She's so cold, I had to go and pour you over ice
Way you got me locked down, you'd think whiskey was my wife
You so good, I had to take you home and hit it twice
Two of you gon' keep me up all night

Whiskey, whiskey, won't you go away?
Come again some other day
'Cause her memory came out to play
And I'm tired of it, tired of it
I don't wanna wonder where she been (Where she at?)

Chasing after that dollar like it'll slow down my hurry
Settle all my worries when I get it in my wallet
Quit dippin' long enough to own a pair of jeans
That don't have a ring in the back left pocket
Laughin' at myself, admittin' when I'm wrong
That's what this good ol' boy's gonna go out workin' on

Workin' on comin' to Jesus, kickin' the bottle
Wrestlin' with our roots
Tryin' to turn off Mama's tears and fill our Daddy's boots
Shuttin' off our pride, fixin' bridges we burned, learnin' how to live and learn
Keepin' our demons down and our trucks up and runnin'
Lovin' them angels sittin' pretty in the middle of 'em
Fightin' with the man in the mirror 'til we gone
Yeah, that's what all us good ol' boys gonna go out workin' on
Gonna go out workin' on

Givin' more forgiveness, pickin' battles worth choosin'
Little less cussin' and losin' my temper and my tools
Dialin' down my restless, outgrowin' my reckless
And my reputation for breakin' hearts and rules
Realizin' I got what I got 'fore it's gone
That's what this good ol' boy's gonna go out workin' on

Workin' on comin' to Jesus, kickin' the bottle
Wrestlin' with our roots
Tryin' to turn off Mama's tears and fill our Daddy's boots
Shuttin' off our pride, fixin' bridges we burned, learnin' how to live and learn
Keepin' our demons down and our trucks up and runnin'
Lovin' them angels sittin' pretty in the middle of 'em
Fightin' with the man in the mirror 'til we gone
Yeah, that's what all us good ol' boys gonna go out workin' on
Gonna go out workin' on

Owning up to my weaknesses, keepin' it humble but strong
Doin' the best I can with this flesh and bone

Workin' on comin' to Jesus, kickin' the bottle
Wrestlin' with our roots
Tryin' to turn off Mama's tears and fill our Daddy's boots
Shuttin' off our pride, fixin' bridges we burned, learnin' how to live and learn
Keepin' our demons down and our trucks up and runnin'
Lovin' them angels sittin' pretty in the middle of 'em
Fightin' with the man in the mirror 'til we gone
Yeah, that's what all us good ol' boys gonna go out workin' on
Gonna go out workin' on"

So I hopped into a car, headed straight to the bar
Poured me out little Hank (huh)
Pulled up some party buses
Girls on top like it's nothin'
Dancin' like no one's in sight
With just one girl in white
They all hopped off of the bus
Two step to the club, yeehaw, giddyup
""Look why didn't you go to Vegas?""

Travel from far and wide
To have a good ass time (a good time)

Monday mornin' rooster, cock a doodle doo
Clock squakin' on the night stand
Slappin' the the alarm off
Stumble to the pot, got coffee on the stove top
Button up the blue collar, time to make the boots walk
Out the front door
Yeah, sun ain't even up yet Sonny
But we sure are yeah, 'cause time is money

And we makin' them dirt road dollars
Way out yonder, out in them hollers
Doin' it like our fathers
Up on them tractors out in them pastures
Makin' it rain like water, farm boy dough
Twenty-four carat gold corn rows
Lunch break bite, couple sweet tea swallers
Right back to makin' them dirt road dollars

Aching, peelin', shuck, stack, diggin', tillin', swing that
Hammer at the two-by forty hours well passed
Racking in the grain cash stacking up the hay stacks
Red clay paid 'cause we ain't afraid to break backs
Or a good sweat nah, the sun ain't gone down yet Sonny
So we ain't done yet, hell nah, 'cause time is money

And we making them dirt road dollars
Way out yonder out in them hollers
Doing it like our fathers
Up on them tractors out in them pastures
Makin' it rain like water, farm boy dough
Twenty-four carat gold corn rows
Lunch break bite, couple sweet tea swallers
Right back to makin' them dirt road dollars

Yeah, uh-huh
I'll be up and at it by your first break
I be work the whole day
I ain't into role play
Catch me in the role cage chillin' just a chewin' up that black dirt
Plowin', plantin', croppin' I ain't stoppin' 'til my ass hurt
Silver queens shuckin' with the farm all truckin'
With them ace 55s boy, y'all ain't seen nothin'
I be gettin' with the pickin' nearly all day
Doin' it all the way croppin' 'til we all pay, hey

There's a long hard road 'til the next one starts
Buddy you don't wanna know what the tractor parts cost
I can get you up a figure for a rig and plow
I got some heifers in the back but I don't sell holy cows
Man that old Ferguson burnin' about 2.50 a gallon
My head churnin' up dirt and I'm up turnin' to plowin', you dig?
Probably do but on your own time
I keep the young-in's supper comin' down the lunch line

And we making them dirt road dollars
Way out yonder out in them hollers
Doing it like our fathers
Up on them tractors out in them pastures
Makin' it rain like water, farm boy dough
Twenty-four carat gold corn rows
Lunch break bite, couple sweet tea swallers
Right back to makin' them dirt road dollars

Come Saturday night I take my baby out on the town
And on Sunday it's church, then lay around the house

And we making them dirt road dollars
Way out yonder out in them hollers
Doing it like our fathers (Like our fathers)
Up on them tractors out in them pastures

Shit I ain't choose to rhyme; rhymin' chose me
So I hit the track runnin' - like a nosebleed
Life ain't great now, but it's much improved
Yo' album droppin' this summer? That sucks for you
'Cause this is Bubba's moment - I put my mother on it
I said my momma; it seems as if I love her don't it?
So buckle up, cause it's gon' get bumpy
I call my girlfriends Betty's, and my shits grumpies
That Bubba talk - gotcha open wide
I giggle outside the booth; but ain't no joke inside
This is complicated - at least to y'all it is
Just let me sell fifty million, then I'll call it quits
But until that day, y'all in deep doo doo
I never once saw you crank it cause I just leap through you
What you need to do, is just admit you love me
The South has always been Dirty but now it's gettin' ugly

Ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly
In here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!

Though I am country, don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin' bigger, with every song I hear
'Cause y'all been bullshittin', spittin' that booty chatter
Out here for two days and came with somethin' that truly matters
On goes the saga - of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrow, if I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now; I hate it came to this
How else can I say it I don't speak no other languages
I'm fairly ripped now, so this the jimmy talkin'
You hear that beat don'tcha? That's just Timmy talkin'
Go 'head throw dem' bows - fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose, ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just forget what we discussin'
This that new South - take a picture of me
'Cause I'm a fuckin' legend, and this is gettin' ugly

Ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly
In here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!

Now this thang is jumpin' - ain't it somethin'?
What makes it special, this whole moment came from nothin'
Now you see it triples; I bet she slurp tonight
Lames hide your wallets hatin' broads clutch your purses tight
If you ain't tryin' to live, you with the wrong crowd
And if you feelin' brave then better sport that thong proud
And if you finally breathin', then sing this song loud
I'm glad I got you wet I know you had a long drought
Don't worry about the law - they can't arrest us all
I had to crank couldn'ta done nothin' less for y'all
Forget your inhibitions; I wanna see you wylin'
And if Bubba dies tonight - know he was smilin'

Ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly

I woke up this mornin', tied my boots up
Cause I knew it's goin' to be a long day
Fired my truck up, grabbed my coffee
Kissed my baby, got on my way
Cause I'm workin' 'til it's hurtin'
That's the only way to make an honest day's pay
So I'm workin' even when it's hurtin'
That's the only way to make an honest day's wage

Yeah, I'm up early with the birdies, ready to get dirty
This ain't a song for you if you asleep at 7:30
I rise like the sun; I'm the bag of the pounds
A full throttle in the bottle like that home-made shine
I'm just tryin' to make a livin', boss man trippin'
My overtime's strong; I don't pay him no attention
Money in the mason jar, country boy pension
Old  lady, three kids, take a lot to fill the kitchen
Fingernails dirty, my back stay hurtin'
You can bet I got to play for every penny that I'm earnin'
I ain't askin' for a raise, but I know the boss heard me
Nobody on this job site's workin' like I'm workin'

Thirty below to a hundred degrees
You ain't pushin' hard enough if your hands don't bleed
I'm the first to clock in and the last to leave
I ain't never had a problem rollin' up my sleeves

I woke up this mornin', tied my boots up
Cause I knew it's goin' to be a long day
Fired my truck up, grabbed my coffee
Kissed my baby, got on my way
Cause I'm workin' 'til it's hurtin'
That's the only way to make an honest day's pay
So I'm workin' even when it's hurtin'
That's the only way to make an honest day's wage

I'm out the door by the sun up, focused on the come-up
We never sleep in, that ain't how we was brought up
I push it to the limit when the money gets low
And been known to work past when the plant whistle blows
Pay check feelin' like a lottery ticket
I might save a couple bucks if my kids don't spend it
It don't matter cause I love it every day of my life
Spent more time on the clock than I do with my wife

State to state, never late, puttin' miles on the road
Drop it off, fill it up, get me to my next load
Call my old lady, let her know I'll be late
And I ain't worry cause I know that she goin' to save me a plate
I told you ...

Thirty below to a hundred degrees
You ain't pushin' hard enough if your hands don't bleed
I'm the first to clock in and the last to leave
I ain't never had a problem rollin' up my sleeves

I woke up this mornin', tied my boots up
Cause I knew it's goin' to be a long day

Well, I walk into the room
Passing out hundred dollar bills
And it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill
And I buy the bar a double round of  Crown
And everybody's getting down
An' this town ain't never gonna be the same

Cause I saddle up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy
Well I don't give a dang about nothing
I'm singing and Bling-Blinging
While the girls are drinking
Long necks down!
And I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy
Or my Chevrolet for your Escalade
Or your freak parade
I'm the only John Wayne left in this town

And I saddle up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy

I'm a thourough-bred
That's what she said
In the back of my truck bed
As I was gettin' buzzed on suds
Out on some back country road
We where flying high
Fine as wine, having ourselves a big and rich time
And I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go
But her evaluation
Of my cowboy reputation
Had me begging for salvation
All night long
So I took her out giggin frogs
Introduced her to my old bird dog
And sang her every Wilie Nelson song I could think of
And we made love

And I saddled up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy

What? What?

You point the blame at other people, so toxic that it's lethal
And your love is filled with poison, narcissism is the needle
I can’t even much believe youuuuu
No, I don't really wanna see youuuu
You can blame it on my ego, blame it on my pride
Man, it's probably ’cause I keep it bottled up, so deep inside
That I could never really love you, nooo
' Cause I'm so broken that I can't trust you
You don't love me, I don't love you
(Verse 1)
You reminisce our interactions
You played me on the back end
You can tell mе that you love me, you ain't show that with your actions
I ain't addin’, I’m subtractin'
The smilеs and the actin’
This toxicity outweighs all of the kissin' and the laughin'
I ain't playin’ any games, I'm not Atari
I know I'm far from bein' Ken, but you're no Barbie
And all I ever think about is how you harmed me
My mentality is fuck it, I can't do this shit and I'm sorry
(Hook)

You can blame it on my ego, blame it on my pride
Man, it's probably 'cause I keep it bottled up, so deep inside
That I could never really love you, nooo
'Cause I'm so broken that I can't trust you
You don't love me, I don't love you
(Verse 2)
I tattooed broken on my face, 'cause let's he honest, it's true
See I don't even love myself, so it's hard to show love to you
I had belief inside myself, I tried to trust you, it's true
But I can't do that, 'cause of all the stuff you constantly do
I showed you loyalty, I thought you might be fit for a crown
Meanwhile you textin' dudes at 3am when I'm not around
And that's so crazy in my eyes 'cause I was holdin' it down
But in the end I wasn't nothin' but the role of a clown, ugghhhhh

You can blame it on my ego, blame it on my pride

Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Ayy, baby

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord,"" she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

Well, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, heh
So, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Well, she was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck""

Baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, heh
So, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

When that summer sun fell to his knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man, we felt so right

I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart

And it's a shame that we
Gotta spend our time bein' mad about the same things
Over and over again about the same thing

I remember the last breath you took right in front of me
When you said that you would leave
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you or say anything
But I see clearly now

Leavin' all my pain in the rear view
'Cause I don't wanna deal with it
Got more problems than 99, I wish that it was 99
So I could make some time for mom and I
And breath some more for my kinfolk
But I'm stuck out here in the real world
And you're God damn right I've been broke
So I'm gettin' it, I'm livin' it
And when shit pops off I deal with it
And I learned real quick how to be a man
When I was livin' in my truck eatin' Peter Pan
And it's not real far from where I'm at
I remember that, gettin' paid with rap, now imagine that
I'm a brand new man put the truck in drive, I packed my bags
And if you're not shotgun I'm good with it, I can ride solo
I'ma die alone, I don't need nobody but my fuckin' self
I'ma ride this shit like a rodeo
I got more room in my resume, goin' worldwide
Gettin' paid today, gettin' criticized and I'm real irate
But they can never really take my bars away
'Cause I'm breathin' them, and I believe in them
And I'm rappin' all my stress away
Photo-shop the scars on my heart
It'll beat a little better but the pain will stay
And I'm never turnin' back from the road I've come
I stand by all that shit the same, and I'll take the blame
'Cause I lit the flame, and if you stand in the way, I'm takin' aim

I got a wallet in my pocket, a dollar for my soul
Prayin' for tomorrow, livin' on the road
This hunger in my stomach, is keepin' me alive
Avoidin' every moment that I gotta say goodbye
I got a wallet in my pocket, a dollar for my soul
Prayin' for tomorrow, livin' on the road
This hunger in my stomach, is keepin' me alive
Avoidin' every moment that I gotta say goodbye

Only one thing that I truly know and that's never give my pain away
'Cause I can bare what a man, normally can't
And if all were to fall, I'd lay awake
And I'd toss and I'd turn to the 808 of my heart beating like a drum, and I'd go with it, and I'd roll with it
'Cause I'm alive and I drive on the road with it
From the pen, to the pad, to the booth, to the fans
I'm livin' in my glory days I'm kickin' it up on the cloud nine
Figurin' out what my story say
From the Blue Lagoon to The Fire in Philly
My boot prints on that fuckin' map
And you can bet your ass it took a lot of hard work
From the needle in my arm to the beat of my heart, let's go

I want my moment, I'm wanderin' and I'm roamin'
I'ma ride it like I stole it, I'm a real fuckin' problem
I'ma, rock star, and a modern day outlaw
We're at war if you're prayin' for my downfall
I know I'm chosen, I'm open to any omen
A showman, and my component is that I'ma broken poet
I'ma rock star, and a modern day outlaw
We're at war if you're prayin' for my downfall

I got a wallet in my pocket, a dollar for my soul
Prayin' for tomorrow, livin' on the road
This hunger in my stomach, is keepin' me alive
Avoidin' every moment that I gotta say goodbye
I got a wallet in my pocket, a dollar for my soul
Prayin' for tomorrow, livin' on the road

Avoidin' every moment that I gotta say goodbye

Yeah yeah
That's right

We talk about your work, how your boss is a jerk
We talk about your church and your head when it hurts
We talk about the troubles you've been having with your brother
About your daddy and your mother and your crazy ex-lover
We talk about your friends and the places that you've been
We talk about your skin and the dimples on your chin
The polish on your toes and the run in your hose
And God knows we're gonna talk about your clothes
You know talking about you makes me smile
But every once in awhile

I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one
Oh my, me my
What I think, what I like, what I know, what I want, what I see
I like talking about you, you, you, you, usually, but occasionally
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)

We talk about your dreams and we talk about your schemes
Your high school team and your moisturizer cream
We talk about your nanna up in Muncie, Indiana
We talk about your grandma down in Alabama
We talk about your guys of every shape and size
The ones that you despise and the ones you idolize
We talk about your heart, about your brains and your smarts
And your medical charts and when you start
You know talking about you makes me grin
But every now and then

I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one

Gwone kinfolk tell ya mamanem
Chug-a-lugga, chug-a-lugga, chug-a-lugga who?
The big blackneck comin' through to you
Boy, you done fell and bumped your head
Uh-huh, that's what they said
People said it's impossible
Not probable, too radical
But I already been on the CMA's
Hell Tim McGraw said he like the change
And he likes the way my hick-hop sounds
And the way the crowd screams when I stomp the ground
I'm big and black, clickety-clack
And I make the train jump the track like that

From mic to cassette deep into your ear
My voice is your choice that you wanted to hear
Southern boy makin' noise where the buffalo roam
Flesh, denim and bone as you might have known
See me ridin' into town like a desperado
With a big belt buckle, the cowboy bravado
All over the world wide web you'll see
Download CBT on an mp3
Speak clearly what I'm sayin' so you'll comprehend
Hit the net for hick-hop radio, tune in
Rollin' like thunder on the scene
It's kinda hard to describe if you know what I mean
I never claimed to be the hardest of the roughest hard rocks
But I'm boomin' out yo' box
Skills got you jumpin' outch'a socks
From Texas here I come, movin' yo body with a bass kick drum!

Alright, boys
This is her favorite song, you know that, right?
So if we play it good and loud
She might get up and dance again
Oh, she put her beer down
Here she comes, here she comes
Left, left, left, right, left
Woo

Hustlers shootin' eight ball, throwin' darts at the wall
Feelin' damn near ten feet tall, here she comes, Lord, help us all
Ol' T.W.'s girlfriend done slapped him out his chair
Poor ol' boy, it ain't his fault, it's so hard not to stare

At that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm, make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And ooh-wee, shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk

Aw, son

Now, honey, you can't blame her for what her mama gave her
It ain't right to hate her for workin' that money-maker
Band shuts down at two, but we're hangin' out 'til three
We hate to see her go, but love to watch her leave

With that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm, make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And ooh-wee, shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
With that honky tonk badonkadonk

Oh, that's what I'm talkin' about right there, honey

We don't care about the drinkin', barely listen to the band
Our hands, they start to shakin' when she gets the urge to dance
Drivin' everybody crazy, you think you fell in love
Boys, you better keep your distance
You can look, but you can't touch

That honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm, make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And ooh-wee, shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the sheriff on the phone

We like to meet at the hollar, build a fire, drink a beer

We keep our trucks lifted up so high
We gotta lock 'em down into four-wheel drive
Sideways in a mud hole, that's just how it goes
'Round here, I'm talkin' 'bout the southern land

Grab a six-pack son, go and hop in the back
Everybody 'round here know where the party's at
Down a real long road on private land
Passed down to me from my old man
Yeah, we get rowdy, crank it up too loud
Southern pride still makes me proud
Them long legs still drive me wild
When there's nowhere to go just drivin' 'round
Ain't nothin' like a sunset sinkin' on down
With a sun-kissed girl sittin' eyes on me
Take a picture for the moment so time will freeze
If you're lookin' for me, you'll know where I'll be

That's all I keep on tellin' myself
Big boy diamonds, big boy spots
Big boy ballin', got these hoes stalkin' us
Anytime she see me when I pull up on the bitch, I be dead fresh
That nigga fresh as hell, bruh
Anytime they see me when I pull up on them niggas, I be iced out
That nigga blingin' like fuck
Ain't no ordinary nigga, I'm a living legend
I'm 'bout to text my ex bitch tell she missed a blessing
You missed it

Ballin' like I'm Stockton
Fucking on the thot, my pockets stuffed up just like stockings
Smoking on the cookie, I got diamonds water moccassin
Niggas get to talkin', yeah that Uzi get poppin' 'em
All about that broccoli
Walk up in the club with them VVS twinkling
Hit ‘em with the doo’s doo's, make them bodies start to weakenin'
Work her in the kitchen whip it, skrt skrt whippin' it
Ain't talkin' 'bout money, close the curtains on the Bentley

Yeah, we came from the Nawf and we had no respect
I told you that young Offset not gon' go for that
I jumped up in the crowd, punched him like Ron Artest
I'm pushin' the dash, I'm going 110 this is a 600S
These bitches be cappin', they talkin' about this
But all they want is sex
I deserve to ball, I wanted to scoop me a 100 on new Patek's
Bitch you know I'm a dog
Finesse for the check, now her nigga keep callin' with threats
And I sold it all that shit is outgoing, I'm bout to go board on a jet
I'm doing a show in Amsterdam and they can't match the murder with that
Hot in the kitchen a 100 degrees these niggas can't handle the pan
These niggas will knock you off for a lil fee they taking a couple of racks
In the Lambo, sometimes it be hard to breath because the engine in the back

Ballin' like I'm Stockton

The times we
Went rolling without knowing where we were going and
World was ours but we didn't know it
So wild, so free, living eternally
Through memories of you and me I'm thinking 'bout
The times we had (Chillin' on a back road)
The times we had (Bumpin' somethin' up on the radio)
The times we'll have
When I see you again, I'll always love you my friend
And I'm thankful for the times we had

Think about them good old days
Think about them good old friends
Think about the things we did
Thinking that would never end
But I was wrong and I wanna tell y'all
Got a few more miles underneath my belt (That's right)
Hold on to everything you feel 'cause time won't stop
That is how you felt
Never take one moment for granted
Never let 'em break your dreams
It's your life, do it how you planned it
Y'all just keep doing your thing
See, everybody gonna have an opinion
Everybody gonna think they know (They don't)
Everybody is around when you're winnin'
Everybody ain't around when you don't (They broke)
I'm keeping it real as an OG
Make sure my team keep winnin'
This world don't stop for no one
Every day it keeps on spinnin'
Just let them haters keep hatin'
We'll just keep makin' 'em mad
I'll ride or die with y'all anytime
Thank God for the times we've had

When I see you again, I'll always love you my friend
And I'm thankful for the times we had

Yeah, I'm reminiscing on them days when we were fishin'
On the lake and we were catchin' good times
We were kicking, back, back flipping off the back deck
Living for the moment and no one could tell us nothing about life
We drive at night on a back road hitting pot holes till the sun show
We'd ride that loop from Walmart to Sonic 'round and 'round we go
Every time I see an old Ford I remember us cutting cookies
In old Buck's front yard
I know you'd say you don't be this way but life seemed so hard
'Cause I know the man you was and I know you would have gone so far
So when I pray at night I look up and wish on star
Yeah, I get down until I look down at my scars from the time we

Went rolling without knowing where we were going and

That must be one of those rednecks I've heard about!

Hop in the truck, come on lets roll
Just bought a case of beer
Now we headin' for a mud hole (haha)
County boys and we do it right
Got the bill of my hat pointing strait to the sky (yeah man)
Carhartt and Wranglers on
Bass Pro hat, camouflage on my phone (look)
Got the Browning decal on the back
Right next to a G
What you know about that
I'm country and that's how we live
If ya got moonshine then I'm takin' a sip (haha, there you go)
Some folks call me a redneck
I smile and take it as a compliment (hah)
I live life the only way I know how
Walk with a swagger and I rep the south (yea)
And if you see me as I'm riding through the crowd
I'm hangin' out the window screamin' it loud

Yeah buddy, rollin' like a redneck
Trucks jacked up I got a smoke stacks
Nuts hanging off the hitch
And a system in the back that'll make your nose itch (haha)

And I'm ridin' that tight (that tight, that tight)
Son I'm ridin' so tight that my tires sound like a damn bull dog bite

Wakin' people up as I ride through at night
And don't forget about the skyjacker lift kit
How you think I made the 44's fit (haha)
Don't you know we ain't playin' around
Six twelves in the back helpin' out with the sound (nope)
And I got a train horn if you too slow
Speed up or I'm lettin' it blow (haha)
If your ridin' to close from behind
I got spotlights that will turn you blind (ooh)
Yeah, so back off you don't want none
Hangin' on the back glass ain't a BB gun fool (ooh)

I got a girl ridin' shottie and she likes the way my Kenwood's bump
She likes a little bump in her country
Turn the radio up turn the bass down low
Put on a country song and take it down an old dirt road

She like that bump in her trunk
She like that bang in her twang
A little country with a twist, turn it up and she sangs
Shes likes the radio as loud as it would get on a dirt road
And good apple pie cooked slow on a wood stove
She's country to the bone a damn ten with some boots on
Every time I pull up to the creek bank it's on
Southernfied beauty she's a one of a kind
Up on his star lit tailgate she'll blow your mind

I got a girl ridin' shottie and she likes the way my Kenwood's bump
She likes a little bump in her country
Turn the radio up turn the bass down low
Put on a country song and take it down an ol' dirt road
It's goin' down we gettin' drunk
Got a 454 ain't never been stuck
You like that shine, well you in luck
Let's throw a me and you party in the bed of my truck

Well she's a hell raisin' lil' mama from way back in the woods
She likes some Hank Williams Jr and some Johnny B. Goode
She likes gettin' jacked up trucks stuck in the mud
With nothin' less than a 350 under the hood
She likes the sound of the pipes at the change of the light
When I drop it in first and ride it out in the night
Hit an old dirt road pull out a bottle of shine
And on that star lit tailgate watch her blow your mind

I got a girl ridin' shottie and she likes the way my Kenwood's bump
She likes a little bump in her country
Turn the radio up turn the bass down low
Put on a country song and take it down an ol' dirt road

Hey boy, is your bench seat ready for a shotgun queen like me?

On cleanin' this Ford and a red head flannel that you'll end up takin' 'cause you wanna sleep in it

Proud to be stuck out in the middle of nowhere
USA, Chevrolet, Dodge and Ford
Raisin' a little hell and praising the Lord (yes sir)
Just simple truth speakin', workin' for the weekend
Every time it hits the fan you just keep on keepin'
You tried and true, red white and blue

Where the two lane turns into Main Street
Cruisin' the same streets
Over in the passenger seat
Baby ain't never looked better just singin' along
To this drivin' around song

Yeah, I know what I’m talkin' about
I grew up in them rural routes
Counting down them days 'til I got brave enough to bust out
City lights in my sights, I’m gonna do it up right
I’m sittin' here with this guitar tonight, alright
Kickin' it in the big town, wishin' I'd a slowed it down
And I give anything if I was drivin' around
With the big dreams in my pocket
Yeah, this is for the ones who don’t know how good they got it

Get in your truck, get in your car, whatever it is, (hey hey hey)

Ol' lady hot and heavy and I know she wanna play
But my cell phone's buggin'
My crew's on a mission for the back road business
Hundred gallon full of sip and fire up the 'ol Chevy
Stick of pine in the wind, dirt-dirt road swervin'
Tryin' to catch my third wind

Blue flame whiskey on that home grown pine
Load a couple cases make a toast to our kin
Kept us here goin' since way back when
Now running wide open on a full moon night
Chasing this paper, tryin' to get my life right

We party 'til we drop, wake up party tomorrow
Ain't no reason to go, if you ain't goin' hard
If anyone deserves a celebration, it'd be us

Tatted-up
I’m gassed up
I’m throwed off and I’m buck wild
Loud and rowdy
I’m a son of the dirty south

This that southern playalistic Willie smokin’, whiskey sippin’
Southern like my momma’s kitchen
Gravy biscuits, fried chicken, backroads, I’m still tippin’
Wood wheel, I’m still grippin’
Stand strong, no ass kissin’
Ol’ school ass whippin’
Come from the bottom nothin’ is a problem
Say get ‘em, I got ‘em, I promise
My roots are blue-collar
Them boys from the holler
Do anything that they can just for a dollar
Pit bulls in the yard
Broken down cars
I’m like fuck it, I’m high
I pull up trailer park pimpin’
With a double-wide dime

‘Cause I’m a son of the dirty south
Got to trippin’
Mama washin’
Out my dirty mouth
And pickin’ switches
I’m a hell raisin’ rebel
That you better never trеad on
Gun-totin’ drinkin’ smokin’
Hoss that you can bet on
Tatted-up I’m gassed up I’m throwеd off and I’m buck wild
Loud and rowdy
I’m a son of the dirty south

Loud and rowdy
I’m a son of the dirty south

I’m from a place where they mix rock, county, and hip-hop
Somewhere between Hank, Three 6, and Kid Rock, Johnny Cash all black
It’s that old-school flavor
Sippin’ something
Rippin’ more lines than notebook paper
Outlaw spirit
My middle finger stuck up again
Bad boy
We all know good women love troubled men
Got that music cranked loud
We won’t turn shit down
Peaceful people but believe it, we gon’ burn shit down

Oh, I’m a son of the dirty south
Got to trippin’
Mama washin’
Out my dirty mouth
And pickin’ switches
I’m a hell raisin’ rebel that you better never tread on
Gun-totin’, drinkin’, smokin’ hoss that you can bet on
Tatted-up I’m gassed up I’m throwed off and I’m buck wild
Loud and rowdy
I’m a son of the dirty south

You know some folks won’t change
We stand for the flag and kneel to pray
It’s the land of the free because of the brave
From the cradle to the grave
We were made in the USA

I’m a son of the dirty south
Got to trippin’
Mama washin’
Out my dirty mouth
And pickin’ switches
I’m a hell raisin’ rebel that you better never tread on
Gun-totin’, drinkin’, smokin’ hoss that you can bet on
Tatted-up I’m gassed up I’m throwed off and I’m buck wild
Loud and rowdy
I’m a son of the dirty south
Loud and rowdy
I’m a son of the dirty south

Listen

Too many people thought I would never get far
And never supported the show (Dang)
And one of my teachers pulled me out of my class
To tell me my grades were low (Wow)
I never do good when people all in my lil' personal space
Invadin' it though (Haha)
That's when I knew that I had to get out and go get it
'Cause they weren't gon' do it no more (Ah, ah, ah)
Took off jet fast, now I'm on they tails
Don't tell 'em that school is out (But)
But all my partners with me, stayed out the city
And showed 'em a different lil' route (Real)
""Ain't got a problem with sinnin', I love me some Jesus""
Yeah, that came out of my mouth
Now let 'em country girls and outlaws
Come straight out of the South (Eh, eh, eh, eh)

(Yeah, I done came a long way)
Let me take you back and show you where I'm from (Uh, uh, where I'm from)
(I done came a long way)
Was down bad and they told me I was done (Yeah, yeah, yeah, see, I was done)
(I done came a long way)
Now I'm hardly home and always on the run (Yeah, yeah, on the run)
(I can say I came a long way)
And I can say that it was hard for me (Yeah, for me)

(I can say I came a long way)
And I can say that it was hard for me

Yeah
The hooligans, new again, flowin' in, movin' souls
Need no Xans, need no 'Grams, only IG when I roll
I just post up with the dawgs, change your life wit' a bop
What I'm on so LeBron, He still the King, do my flops
Ayy, K to the second, the rapper, the reverend
This rapper's a weapon of God
Ayy, man wit' a message, you want a request
And I pull up like grippin' the balls
Ayy, KB and Lathan, don't get it mistaken
The fame that we gain is a walk
Ayy, we give our glory to God
But our story all for you and put it in song, boy

When the sun goes down you know where I'll be
With a case of good time and some John Deere green
Kickin' sparks to the sky I'm in my zone
Every night sprayin' on that campfire cologne
A campfire cologne
And you know I'm not alone
A campfire cologne

That aroma on my clothes takes me back farther backyard
We'd build ourselves a pile and light up a bonfire
We'd have the best times and never even try
Good friends made good company we'd blast every time
We'd blaze it up and let it burn high
Dance around the flames joke on one another callin' each other names
We never took it personal we was brothers and best friends
Just livin' in the moment felt like it'd never end
We did some good smokin', a good bit of day drinkin'
Stinkin' up lies to tell and hell the river rope swingin'
I lost track of some of y'all but now you're on my mind
And this smell on my shirt makes me think about the good times

When the sun goes down you know where I'll be
With a case of good time and some John Deere green
Kickin' sparks to the sky I'm in my zone
Every night sprayin' on that campfire cologne
A campfire cologne
And you know I'm not alone
A campfire cologne

Man that smell on my clothes brings back the good times
We were all raisin' hell, I'd sing songs and make rhymes
And no one was listenin', then it was just y'all
On highway 18 in the yard playin' ball
With no flags no tags strictly tackle
Then we'd crank a flame, crack a bottle and laugh like nothin' happened
The smell from the pine tree, needles, and cones, is like a time machine
When it was David Jones
We didn't have to be responsible and pay no bills
Wasn't thinkin' 'bout raisin' babies, negotiatin' deals
And even though I'm grateful now, I'll never forget
The way we grew through the smell of the flames, it makes me reminisce

When the sun goes down you know where I'll be
With a case of good time and some John Deere green
Kickin' sparks to the sky I'm in my zone
Every night sprayin' on that campfire cologne
A campfire cologne
And you know I'm not alone
A campfire cologne

Just light it up, light it up and let it burn high
Live your life the way you want to like you'll never die
Just light it up, light it up and let it burn high
Live your life the way you want to like you'll never die
Just light it up, light it up and let it burn high
Live your life the way you want to like you'll never die
Just light it up, light it up and let it burn high

Fights are a contest, don't know when to calm it down

With you, I never know what tomorrow might bring
I bring you to tears and I know it's gotta sting
When you beg me to stay after telling mе to leave
If I could take back thе words I would, you would change if you could
I'd kiss the tears off your face, I know you're no good
But my love for you won't die
You still love a sinner and I don't know why
You tell me you're packing up, tell me you've had enough
Pretend that I'm heartless, but really, I'm acting tough
Sometimes your mask gets stuck, my pride got me faking now
You got your walls up, you can't see me breaking down
Hold me like December, love me like I'm crazy
Your heart's stuck in winter, no one else but you can save me

Down by the riverside, hanky panky
Where them girls bad, yes, ma'am, please and thank you (Appreciate it)
Where them boys ride slow 'cause them roads is dangerous
It's a real thin line 'tween snakes and angels

Crawfish with the cornbread, yeah, this as real as it gets (Oh)

Get (Get) that (That) mud off my tires
Dirty south in the house, comin' straight out the bayou (Bayou)
We got that catfish fryin', comin' fresh off the bottom
I got a bad bitch with a buckshot ridin' shotty
Met her down in Tulane ('Lane)
So you know she got good brain (Brain)

Oh, It's just another thing to me

Another day on the grind for a couple cents
I kiss goodbye to my relevance
The world throws stones while I ride the fence
I'm holdin' on enough to bring up something that finally makes sense
It's like I'm livin' in a war zone
And they can write it on my tombstone
Here lies a man that don't cry
With ash on the feet in front pillar heels
I've been up and I've been down
But my place ain't on the ground
I'd rather meet death on my feet and life on my knees
Trouble ain't nothin' but another damn thing to me

I've been up and I've been down
And I've been beat and pushed around
I'll pick myself up off the ground
Just wait and see
'Cause it's just another thing to me
Just another bridge I'll have to burn
Just another lesson I'm bound to learn
Buddy ain't damn thing changin' me
So watch and see (Boy that's right)
'Cause it's just another thing to me

You know it ain't a thing with it
So I focus on the game but I can't get it
I got my people wonderin' if I still got it
So I'm reachin' out the window for my pill bottle
And I will follow
Devil wanna ride with me but I ain't lettin' him
I got a lot of my problems but I ain't stressin'
I'm on a path of my past of my days gone
I keep on fightin' and I'm tryin' to find my way home
Head to the sky and ride just to stay strong
My time tickin', quicker like I'm on a payphone
They don't wanna hire me 'cause my piss is cloudy
Lookin' down, but they don't know nothin' 'bout me
They bringin' the wickedest sickest person out of my soul
So I'm takin' 'em, makin' 'em work down them old dirt roads
I rearrange some things but there ain't no changin' me
Man it's plain to see, it's just another thing to me

I've been up and I've been down
And I've been beat and pushed around
I'll pick myself up off the ground
Just wait and see
'Cause it's just another thing to me
Just another bridge I'll have to burn
Just another lesson I'm bound to learn
Buddy ain't damn thing changin' me
So watch and see (Let's go)
'Cause it's just another thing to me

It's in the past man, so don't think about that
Made some real bad choices, I can't take back
That's why I don't brag about the things I own
Cause I can make a wrong turn and it'll all be gone
I still bust my ass to make ends meet
I understand a better plan is on it's way for me
And hey it's just another day
And I'll get by
Just keep walkin' with my head high, you know

I've been up and I've been down
And I've been beat and pushed around
I'll pick myself up off the ground

Meanwhile I'm soaked in gasoline

Please understand if you shake the tree
You gotta deal with the wasps and rake the leaves
Man my life had tragedy
So they taught me somethin' 'bout agony
I done seen a lot of shit go up and down
And that taught me somethin' 'bout gravity
I feel the good times over the horizon
I can feel 'em comin' with the sun shinin'
But forgive me for the times I was blinded
From the nights that I thought I was flyin'
'Til you find out that you've fallen and nobody seems to care
Say, Father, God, I'll forgive 'em now 'cause even demons need a prayer
And I changed my life I swear, through the hard times stood right there

When you really need him who's the one that you can call?
I don't give a fuck about it, you can have it all
'Cause the leaves only fall in the fall, yeah they fall in the fall

We fell in love under a full moon
To the sound of howlin' big dogs
Early mornin' gunfire
Blinded by the thick fog
No way out I only see a way in
I'm lookin' for the win
Follow my heart, never a trend
No fear where I've been
'Cause I'm still good at my worst
Survivin' off the lessons
Never asked, just shoot first
Though money never was the fantasy
I fantasized about my family
Gettin' out of tragedy, no casualties
Jax Teller strategy
Bastard born to anarchy
Son of the widow
I sleep pistols under pillows
Since it's eat what you kill
I bite a hard hungry hippo
While my baby weeps underneath
The branches of my willow

Baby, if you love me (Oh baby if you love me), well please love me now (Please love me now)
'Cause baby if you love me (Oh baby if you love me)
It's my darkest hour, it's my darkest hour
If I did you wrong before, I won't do you wrong no more
It's all I've ever known, it's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know
Baby, who's gon' catch you when you fall?
When you really need him who's the one that you can call?
I don't give a fuck about it, you can have it all
'Cause the leaves only fall in the fall, yeah they fall in the fall"

Last of a dyin' breed
True son from the South
I'm from if you backtalk mama
You get busted in the mouth
I'm from that rollin' bubble
In a clear glass jar
Way back in the Mason-Dixon (Mason-Dixon)
Everything is a little too far, yeah

I got frog eyes in the pickle jar
The whiskey still still smokes like old cars
I got a half a pack of cancer sticks left
And I just iced down a thirty pack of regrets
Yeah, we shootin' polecats and catching channel cats
We like a throwback, like an old Johnny Cash track
So you can get a map, buy a magnifyin' glass
Look 'til your eyes hurt, but you won't find where we're at 'cause
We're gettin' dirty down an old dirt road
No city limits in sight
Yeah, go ahead and get a little sideways
Givin' it up tonight
Don't care too much for the drama
You can leave that shit at home
'Round here, we know how to throw it down
So let me tell you where I'm from, I'm from the

Last of a dyin' breed
True son from the South
I'm from if you backtalk mama
You get busted in the mouth
I'm from that rollin' bubble
In a clear glass jar
Way back in the Mason-Dixon (Mason-Dixon)
Everything is a little too far, yeah

I still bowfish and go frog gigging
The viddles on my plate are all God-given
I roll Mossy Oak and mind my own business
Couple tokes of the green got me seein' night vision
I'm from the backside of the boondocks
Where the honeybees swarm in the treetops
Makin' what I need, and it's free, no cost
To get another honey 'shine batch brewed up, uh
Mama raised me in the church, but I quit goin'
Daddy's rebel blood's in me, and it's still flowin'
And it will 'til I'm ill and old
There's no one that can scold me
Until we've been simmer-simmerin' down
So, so put the Crown on the rocks and the beer in the chest
I've been called a mess, but I know that I'm blessed
Because out here is where my head rests
You gotta holler to find me 'cause Verizon can't hear me yet, yet

Black boots, red cup
Brown liquor, no suds
Some bad motherfuckers just rolled up
Yeah
Firecracker, short fuse
I pulled the plug out on you like a corkscrew
No limit, no curfew
Yeah

To get everything I wanted in this lifetime
I had to put my beliefs on the front line
In every song that I sing
It's always been you and me
Tell my baby it'll be another late night
I left work eight hours after midnight
No breaks, no sleep
And it's always been you and me

You know it's always been you and me

Long money, no short change
You're still hatin', poor thing
Middle fingers up, tell you one more thing
Yeah
Ya can't hear me, let me dumb it down
I'm slum by nature from a small town
We tote guns by nature, no showin' out
Yeah

To get everything I wanted in this lifetime
I had to put my beliefs on the front line
In every song that I sing
It's always been you and me
Tell my baby it'll be another late night
I left work eight hours after midnight
No breaks, no sleep
And it's always been you and me

Like a raven over the grave, I get lost over the page
I'm in tune with my spirit, doing shrooms, trip for days
Eighteen with the plats, in the projects with the raps
White boy with the blacks, from the sticks, I crossed the tracks
Rock and roll, rolling stone, daddy left his pistol home
Load it up, shooting bottles off the porch to his songs
I was troubled, I was hurt and it bubbled to the surface
Took it out on writing songs, put that seed up under the dirt
God gave me water (Bless,) two sons and one daughter (Bless)
I prayed and prayed harder (Now I) work hard and play harder, I
Visualize, put thumbtacks over outlines
And when they said I was out of my mind I put more goals in the pipeline, this is my time

To get everything I wanted in this lifetime
I had to put my beliefs on the front line
In every song that I sing
It's always been you and me
Tell my baby it'll be another late night
I left work eight hours after midnight
No breaks, no sleep
And it's always been you and me

Maple stirrups
Banana puddin', where the wrangler put it?
Sterling silver (Uh)
Now gimme more, watch the buckle hit the floor (Yeah, gimme more)

BB on the custom tags
Hot pink on pink, it's wrapped (It's wrapped)
VVs on teeth, he snapped
Let him spoil me, boy know I'm a cheapskate
To the factory, buyin' me a cheesecake
If he buy me cheesecake, l'ma holler
Big boy, big blick, blue collar
Well, I could buy it all myself anyway

Bartender knows the deal better pour another round
Keep a hog leg in my left hand with a bud
Light in my right and my shotgun by my side
By my side

Hydroponic rolled up so we bout to burn up
Bow tie on my grill but I ain't dissing you others
I show respect to my peers I learned alot from my mother
I just bought some new tires you know I learned to burn rubbers
I'm a very vocal hick when I speak I don't stutter
Country girls love me in every city I go
Got em moving side to side, they dropping it down to the floor
Local artists hating on me but that's just how it goes
I don't pay em no attention I just let em be trolls

No I ain’t gotta wear pants two sizes too big
With some baby named shoes talk about my crib
Drive the girls wild, make 'em hop inside my jacked up ride
Sit-sittin' on 35's

My speakers go boom (boom) by the way
With some Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan on the way
That’s that country boy swag (swag)
All day it’s the dirt road boys and them boys don’t play
My speakers go boom (boom) by the way
With some Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan on the way
That’s that country boy swag (swag)
All day it’s the dirt road boys and them boys don’t play
We them boys don’t play

But where I’m from there's some jacked up trucks
Sittin' high on 35's dig deep in the mud
Where huntin' and fishin' everyday is a must
And it’s the red white blue and in God I trust
We ain’t gotta worry 'bout no thieves or crooks
And everybody round here straight lives by the book
But don’t ever disrespect the ladies
But if you do might wind up pushing up daisies
Where everybody drives like Miss Daisy
Tip your hat to the man on the tractor and have patience
We’re all just tryin' to make a dollar
If you’re really from the country let me hear y’all holler

My speakers go boom (boom) by the way
With some Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan on the way

All day it’s the dirt road boys and them boys don’t play
We them boys don’t play

Let me take ya for a ride through the countryside
And show you how we get live at the county line
We just some dirt road boys
Ridin' round straight rompin' in some jacked up toys
Let’s get a little mud on the tires
Poppin' some Aldean and take a little ride
Hit the creek bank and sip a little shine
When the sun goes down we’ll take a skinny dippin' dive

My speakers go boom (boom) by the way

That’s that country boy swag (swag)
All day it’s the dirt road boys and them boys don’t play

Baby I'm bored in the USA
There ain't much to do but sit around here all day
Wake up early work a 9-to-5 job I hate
Tryna pay my credit cards and my rent is late

Ok
I pick a 6 string, in my truck singing Bruce Springsteen
Same pair dirty boots same pair of ripped jeans
It's me; ain't changed a bit since I was 16
Told y'all I'm a small town kid but I got big dreams
Waking up this early every morning got me in a mood
Please don't talk to me until I've had a coffee, maybe two
Yeah, her eyes are baby blue. Yeah, the whiskey 80 proof
Yeah, it's crazy Wavey Davey's back
He's breaking all the rules kid
Swimming in the creek just like it was a pool kid
Up at Go Mart pumping diesel fuel, kid
Still standing like an old barstool kid, I'm on the move kid
Ain't form the Chi, man I'm from the hills deep in Appalachia
Where they die taking all them pills, man, it's a disaster
Every time like this can be real man, he just got his masters
He was fine till his cousin Bill found him on a mattress
It's an everyday story; it ain't nothing new
Round here, it's pretty boring; there ain't much to do
You take the bus to school; pack a lunch with you
Grow up, work a job for 30 years, and have em take your pension out from under you
It's been that way since back when I was little
We saw a broken headlight and we shouted out P'diddle
Back when Walter white was raising Malcolm in the middle
Something's missing here I think we need to add a fiddle

In the Appalachian Valley, off of highway 79
Somewhere down a two-lane road is where I lost my mind

Country singer? Country rapper? I don't care bout labels
I got some friends who serve and I ain't talking waiting tables
I pray they come home soon and, when they do, find something stable
Lord I pray in Jesus name protect them Send me all your angels
It's a wicked world we living in I'm tryna stay alive
Pledge of allegiance to the flag and the star and the stripes
Need a three-piece tender, Diet Coke with some fries
Honey mustard on the side

Baby I'm bored in the USA
There ain't much to do but sit around here all day
Wake up early work, a 9-to-5 job I hate
Tryna pay my credit cards and my rent is late"

Cherry red Chevy, lift kit about a couple feet
Roots in my boots and I ain't gotta prove shit
Follow me down to my woods boy and hop off in these sticks

Shootin' at the ducks while they passin' by my scenery
I came up from nothin' now my face in more than 50 states
Pedal to the metal, I ain't even gonna tap the brakes
And I ain't from the city I'm from hollers, rivers, creeks, and lakes

Chip on my shoulder, rockin' me a heavy farmers tan
Honeys treat me lovely 'cause I'm popular on Instagram
Haters say I'm fakin' shit, say I'm the flame that's barely lit

Oh, It's just another thing to me

Another day on the grind for a couple cents
I kiss goodbye to my relevance
The world throws stones while I ride the fence
I'm holdin' on enough to bring up something that finally makes sense
It's like I'm livin' in a war zone
And they can write it on my tombstone
Here lies a man that don't cry
With ash on the feet in front pillar heels
I've been up and I've been down
But my place ain't on the ground
I'd rather meet death on my feet and life on my knees
Trouble ain't nothin' but another damn thing to me

I've been up and I've been down
And I've been beat and pushed around
I'll pick myself up off the ground
Just wait and see
'Cause it's just another thing to me
Just another bridge I'll have to burn
Just another lesson I'm bound to learn
Buddy ain't damn thing changin' me
So watch and see (Boy that's right)
'Cause it's just another thing to me

You know it ain't a thing with it
So I focus on the game but I can't get it
I got my people wonderin' if I still got it
So I'm reachin' out the window for my pill bottle
And I will follow
Devil wanna ride with me but I ain't lettin' him
I got a lot of my problems but I ain't stressin'
I'm on a path of my past of my days gone
I keep on fightin' and I'm tryin' to find my way home
Head to the sky and ride just to stay strong
My time tickin', quicker like I'm on a payphone
They don't wanna hire me 'cause my piss is cloudy
Lookin' down, but they don't know nothin' 'bout me
They bringin' the wickedest sickest person out of my soul
So I'm takin' 'em, makin' 'em work down them old dirt roads
I rearrange some things but there ain't no changin' me
Man it's plain to see, it's just another thing to me

I've been up and I've been down
And I've been beat and pushed around
I'll pick myself up off the ground
Just wait and see
'Cause it's just another thing to me
Just another bridge I'll have to burn
Just another lesson I'm bound to learn
Buddy ain't damn thing changin' me
So watch and see (Let's go)
'Cause it's just another thing to me

It's in the past man, so don't think about that
Made some real bad choices, I can't take back
That's why I don't brag about the things I own
Cause I can make a wrong turn and it'll all be gone
I still bust my ass to make ends meet
I understand a better plan is on it's way for me
And hey it's just another day
And I'll get by
Just keep walkin' with my head high, you know

I've been up and I've been down
And I've been beat and pushed around
I'll pick myself up off the ground
Just wait and see
'Cause it's just another thing to me
Just another bridge I'll have to burn
Just another lesson I'm bound to learn
Buddy ain't damn thing changin' me
So watch and see
'Cause it's just another thing to me
I've been up and I've been down
And I've been beat and pushed around
I'll pick myself up off the ground
Just wait and see
'Cause it's just another thing to me

I might die tonight, but if I do I'ma be okay (I'ma be okay)
And if I die tonight, at least I stood by the stuff I said
I got two graves dug, one for me and one for the motherfucker standin' in my way
And if I die tonight, at least I can say I never ran away

Yeah, six foot deep, deep, deep in the cut
Shovel and the tarp rolled up in the truck
Couple old bikers and they know whats up
Spend my iTunes check on gettin' people roughed up
And a child molester might end up in the mud
Bones in the shit of a couple wild boars
Teeth buried in the light of a little white church
I be somewhere dog GPS don't work
Where the cops all do things a little bit dirty
But they stay on my team, I got that Baby Face money
Y'all can buy all that jewelry, I'll invest in my community
Put a bunker in the ground, fill it up with plenty shiny things
I got brass for days, pit bulls with teeth so razor sharp
You'd think my female slept with a great white shark
I ain't tryna brag but my A-Team too big
Some crazy motherfuckers on that 1900's shit
It’s time for a change, yeah I came with some buddies
Who don't mind gettin' muddy and bloody and standin' for somethin'
And puttin' some sense into this corrupt country
Go ahead big dog come over here and say somethin' (Aarph)

I might die tonight, but if I do I'ma be okay (I'ma be okay)
And if I die tonight, at least I stood by the stuff I said
I got two graves dug, one for me and one for the motherfucker standin' in my way
And if I die tonight, at least I can say I never ran away (Ran away)

You can get it, I'ma fight 'til the death of me
I ain’t never been known to run from an enemy
Heavily armed to the teeth, got an army with me
And I'm ready to die if you threaten me
AK's, AR's, you ain't who you say you are
Bullets start flyin', puttin' ghosts in the graveyard (Woo)
Full moon lightin' up the battlefield
Battle to my last breath and my blood splatter here (Woo)
Just breathe a minute, just think a minute, you don't wanna go to war
Or we could get it, yeah we could bring it right to your front door
I don't think you wanna go that route
I ain't known to fuck around, fuck around
I'ma throw a hundred rounds
Put your cold body in the fuckin' ground
Get the point bitch, when I hit you with the hollow round
What the fuck you talkin' 'bout? I don't wanna talk about it
Leave your body right there layin' with some chalk around it
Why I gotta go so hard? Why you so fuckin' soft?
Why your man runnin' bitch, you already fuckin' lost

I might die tonight, but if I do I'ma be okay (I'ma be okay)
And if I die tonight, at least I stood by the stuff I said
I got two graves dug, one for me and one for the motherfucker standin' in my way

Now it's, uh

I don't think they really know what it's like
When you comin' from the bottom
If I had it my way, I'd get back to where I started
Just to switch it up a little, red wine, no Bacardi
And we gon' throw our own kind of party
Reminiscin' 'bout the old times
When it didn't get so complicated
Once you moved up out the hood, you thought you made it
Let them good times roll
And you don't even need congratulations
But if they tellin' us, then we'll take it

If I had it my way, every day would be a Friday
We'd be ridin' with the windows down
If I had it my way, I'd hit a hundred on the highway
With the radio turnt up loud
If I had it my way, wе would party all night
Wouldn't worry 'bout a thing, everybody'd be finе

And I don't think they ready if I'm really bein' real

You can feel it through the speakers we got bumpin' in the back (Woo)
Hope you know we goin' big 'cause that's the only way to go

Put the nozzle up, push the throttle down
Pick the bottle up while drivin' slowly through this town
All these demons in my head got me feelin' brain dead
Need to find a bed lay down to let my mind tread
Always livin' in a dream 'cause this old life is too hard
I know this isn't healthy but this bourbon heals my scars
Or maybe it's a cover up and a blanket for this cold soul
Livin' in reality like life without parole
I don't wanna keep livin' like this
'Cause I can't taste reality so I just reminisce about the good times

I'm sittin' countin' memories in a motel
Watchin' the time just slip away
Tryna drink away my reality (Shots, shots, shots)
Tell my troubles to the bottle 'cause it don't tell
But it ain't got too much to say
So I'm stuck right here in my reality
Tryna tell it to the bottle (To the bottle, to the bottle)
Oh man I tell it to the bottle (To the bottle, to the bottle)
I tell it to the bottle (To the bottle, to the bottle)
Oh man I tell it to the bottle (To the bottle, to the bottle)

Get back up, load my truck
Face my fears get out of this muck
Everybody's got them problems gotta fight 'em so you don't get stuck
I don't need to drown, fuckin' clown put the bottle down
Bourbon brown, leave this town
Time to turn my life around
Pull away from that light I just wanna feel alive
Man it just feels so right like the stars have aligned
It ain't easy as one, two, three
Can't you see this ain't a dream
I just wanna be free
It's all on me

I'm sittin countin' memories in a motel
Watchin' the time just slip away
Tryna drink away my reality (Shots, shots, shots)
Tell my troubles to the bottle 'cause it don't tell

So I'm stuck right here in my reality
Tryna tell it to the bottle (To the bottle, to the bottle)
Oh man I tell it to the bottle (To the bottle, to the bottle)
I tell it to the bottle (To the bottle, to the bottle)
Oh man I tell it to the bottle (To the bottle, to the bottle)

Somewhere 'tween the floor and the ceiling fan
Is a world tipped upside down
Spinnin' in the cigarette smoke
Somewhere 'tween the old and the better man
Is a heart turned inside out
Achin' for the pain to go
I'm countin' memories
And wash 'em all away one shot at a time
Eh-eh

I'm sittin countin' memories in a motel
Watchin' the time just slip away
Tryna drink away my reality (Shots, shots, shots)
Tell my troubles to the bottle 'cause it don't tell

I should have never called last night
We break up, we make up and then we do it again
I need another beer
Don't want my vision clear
Small town so I see you everywhere
Dirt roads and four wheel drives
Headlights and shiny nights
Right now that sounds real nice
To get your name off of my mind

Whoa
Windows down, speakers bumpin' like
Whoa
Live my life like a dirt road

Take it slow
Let's see how far we can go
When tomorrow comes we can do it again
Lovin', drinkin', fightin' with all my friends

Oh

Oh
Live my life like a dirt road

Kickin' up dust, slingin' rocks
Shotgun rider watch for cops
The neighbors hate us, want us to stop
Bass too loud but we can't stop
I done forgot about you and all your games
Do not tell me that I'm swervin', this dirt road don't have a lane
My buddy Nicky out the window, AR15 got good aim
Copenhagen got me buzzin', got me spinnin' in my brain
If I take this turn too fast it might hit me back
So I grab the wheel, relax, and I drop it into second
County boy is what I'm reppin'
Beretta and Smith & Wessons
Never hidin', I've been ridin'
This old dirt road got me slidin'

I should have never called last night
We break up, we make up and we do it again
I need another beer
Don't want my vision clear
Small town so I see you everywhere

If you the bullet hole in a stop sign kind

For my country folk (Hey)

I'm out here on a thousand acre plot of land
And I can't hear 'em hatin' on me, I'm a modest man
Talking wit Jimmie Mathis he got a plan
And when he talk I listen to him, that’s a lot of man (Pops)
He said we need to take it back to the root of it
I put on for the country, that’s the truth of it
I’m talkin’ last millennium we was reppin' it
Before anybody had accepted it (Anybody)

Full of cold Natty Light, playing satellite
A little Dave while we misbehave, okay (Okay)
Once we figure the game out, we go play (Go)

Come on girl

I come straight from the ATC (AC)
Down here we do things differently
Hence a little country and a little street
And it's hot as hell but we still roll with heat
We do everything, 'cause ain't a thing to do
Cross me, get stomped out by some Georgia boots
I got some homies in the sticks and I got boys with the sticks
Pullin' up in trucks and 24's on Crown Vics
Might be hood but we country livin'
Get on a dirt road and find some trouble to get in
I'll take no hand-outs, go out and work
Get it out the mud, we was raised in the dirt

'Cause evеrybody down here loves thеm a dirt road
Past curfew that's the way that you take home
When the moon shines that's when you're gon' take a girl alone
When the sun's up that's when you'll go to work on
Take a whip down there when you feel like ridin'
Meet up at the end when you feel like fightin'
Smoke a little dope where your parents can't find ya
Everybody loves a dirt road

Now there's a couple bandos out here where I live
Ain't got what you want but hell I know how to get it
Since I came out the womb that's how a youngin' been livin'
Wet you up with them poles and I ain't talkin' 'bout fishin'
Dope boys ridin' through at night time
If we got a problem hunt you down like wildlife
King George or some Marvin Gaye blarin' out the speakers
He's just mad 'cause his girlfriend be suckin' like a skeeter
It's slower down here, there ain't no traffic
Everybody know me 'cause I look just like my daddy
If you say a thing 'bout the game best believe we're gonna swing
Meet me on that dirt road, see if you feel the same

Everybody down here loves them a dirt road
Past curfew that's the way that you take home
When the moon shines that's when you're gon' take a girl alone
When the sun's up that's when you'll go to work on

Me personally I don't know a whole lot about these city streets
But I do know a little bit about where I come from
And that's that CO, yeah, you know country

Sunset in the background never gets old
Got some dirt on my boots, mud tires on the road
And we all talk alike, yes sir, no ma'am
Seal the deal with a handshake and livin' off the land
Party on the tailgate, drinkin' ice cold beer
Plowin' all day, hard work is in my soul
And we all pray at night that we will get by
Just another story of my backroads life

I'm a Cossatot river runner been floatin' it goin'
Under Lad bridge since I was old enough to what? Hold a paddle
Passin' cattle while paddlin' faster 'cause it's getting late
I'm a master at holdin' three point two ounces throwin' baits
That's right, I chugalug, while chuggin' my Bud on the lake
I keep a bubba jug close in case the game warden shows his face
That is if there ain't an exit 'cause if I can I will escape
And kate away to a place where I'm straight and safe
We're lovers rather than fighters
But trust me you don't want to try us
We'll fight you but afterwards buy you a what?
A round of your choice
We talk in a low tone of voice

And we all pray at night that we will get by

A simple man who raised up on days that passed on
So when I'm ridin' probably vibin' to a Cash song
Makes me think about grand daddy creepin' in his Jon boat
Mixin' up a Crown and Coke, sittin' up in that honey hole
So now I know the river like the back of my hand
And every year my family goes and parks some boats in the sand
Throw some wood in the pile and party all damn night
Just another story of my backroads life

I'm just a backroads eighties baby
Made in the country like grits and gravy
Some of y'all still call me crazy
Thank God the country raised me
Say them boys they came on up
Seen a lot of things since ""Kickin' Up Mud""
I appreciate (Yup) all the love

Gave y'all something so y'all could ride
Been a country boys paradise
One-ninety proof, now let it shine
Been doin' this here since ninety-nine

Packin' our lips up with snuff, give it up for that Red Seal (Yeah)
Ain't nothing quite like fishing in the evenin'

Behind the tree line or runnin' trout lines in the mornin'
With papaw hopin' to pull in some more
Of them flat heads 'cause we wanna have a fish fry

Plowin' all day, hard work is in my soul
And we all pray at night that we will get by
Just another story of my backroads life"

Way out in the country in a old dirt road
I was sippin on a jar that was nice and cold
My Chevy was a jumpin' my music was a bumpin'
Up a head I swore I saw somthin'
Well she was with as long legged with a big ol' butt
Had soft blonde hair that was pretty and cut
I could tell she was stuck and into some trouble
She was walkin' down the road just shaking that bubble
So I pulled up on her with my window down said hey you pretty thing can I drive you to town she said ""thank you baby I was dying of heat ain't had a lick of water ain't had nothin' to eat""
She put her hand on my handle and I said hold up
Before you go climbing into my pick up truck it takes more that a smile to turn these wheels
So before we get going here's the deal

Well if wanna come along with me ain't nothing in the world for free
No ass no gas no grass no ride
If I can't smoke and I can't poke it better get my V8 stroking
No ass no gas no grass no ride

Well she said hell no so I left her there she was shooting me a bird in my rear view mirror
I got a few miles further down the road then my dagum right front tire got blowed
Well wouldn't you know I ain't gotta jack
I left it in my grandpas Cadillac
I started thumbing my ways back into town that when I flag an old punch bug down
Surprise surprise you know who that same damn girl I didn't give a ride to
Now I said baby would you believe I was comin' back to get you when a nail got me
Is pretty damn funny meeting up like this
I hope you ain't the kinda women that will still be pissed
She said ""nah baby its all good as long as its understood""

Well if wanna come along with me ain't nothing in the world for free
No ass no gas no grass no ride
If I can't smoke and I can't poke it better get my V8 stroking
No ass, no gas no grass no ride
Well if wanna come along with me ain't nothing in the world for free
No ass ,no gas no grass no ride
If I can't smoke and I can't poke it better get my V8 stroking
No ass, no gas no grass no ride"

I'm not tryin' to complain, I'm so thankful for what I got
I work my fingers to the bone but these bills they never stop
No matter how much overtime I get it ain't quite enough
The mortgage get's late, something breaks and that's when the times get tough
And bad things come in threes but I wish that wasn't true
'Cause I don't think I can take another after this one and two
There's still a roof over our head and plenty of food to eat
Clean clothes for both of the kids, socks and shoes on their feet
And they got no idea I'll never let them see me sweat
I'll do what I got to do to make it right with no regrets
And if my stress gets to high then I will take a step outside
Embrace the sounds the nature makes my backyard lullaby

Listen to the crickets sing, the rattle of the dog chain
Listen to the southbound breeze just creepin' through the trees
And the creak of the weather vein
Sittin' in my lawn chair, sending up a little prayer, I need some answers tonight
Turn my troubles down low, Lord soothe my soul
One more time with the backyard lullaby

Like every other workin' man I go through tryin' times
When responsibilities weight heavy on my mind
And I just need to get away and take a walk outside
I don't need no flashlight, I got stars and moonshine
Than the breeze starts whistlin', the whippoorwill starts singin'
I love listenin' to forget the way that I'm feelin'
'Cause sounds I hear at night I don't notice in the day
All the dogs barkin' loud like they got something to say
Engines in the diesel trucks roaring down the highway
I feel bass beatin' in speakers a mile away
If my tension starts to rise I got to be outside
That's the only place I can hear my backyard lullaby

Listen to the crickets sing, the rattle of the dog chain
Listen to the southbound breeze just creepin' through the trees
And the creak of the weather vein
Sittin' in my long chair, sending up a little prayer, I need some answers tonight
Turn my troubles down low, Lord soothe my soul
One more time with the backyard lullaby
Listen to the crickets sing, the rattle of the dog chain
Listen to the southbound breeze just creepin' through the trees
And the creak of the weather vein
Sittin' in my long chair, sending up a little prayer, I need some answers tonight
Turn my troubles down low, Lord soothe my soul
One more time with the backyard lullaby"

I'm just a country boy (Boy) with a big ole truck (Truck)
The only way I ride (Ride) I keep it jacked up (Yeah)
I got some big tires, they make some big ruts
And every time I drive yeah, I be kickin' up mud
(Kickin' up mud)
I got that Real Tree across the leather seats
I got two 12's in the back bumpin' coming down the streets
I'm cranking Johnny Cash I'm talkin' Man in Black
And if you don't like it then y'all can kiss my country ass
(I'm kickin' up mud)
30.06 on my back gun rack
See a whitetail buck put him on his back
7mm or 12 gauge shotty
We ain't tryin' to get drunk or hurt nobody
Lordy lordy you got a sexy body
Just get muddy and shake it shawty
Crunk in the mud slap gettin' drunk
Dirty dancin' kickin' up mud

Big truck (Big truck), big tires (Big tires)
Slangin' mud (Slangin' mud) to the sky (To the sky)
Livin' low, ridin' high
Kickin' up mud in my four-wheel drive

Livin' low, ridin' high

Cut me loose, let me go
I gotta go find that mud hole
Feel so sweet, I just creep
But call it my riverado
Better bring your rope, bring your chain
We get riled up when it starts to rain
Like oh my, look at that truck
I bet ya a beer that it won't get stuck
(Kickin' up mud)
Pulled up slow pulled up nice Mickey Thompson's 45s
Pretty little girl with some tanned up thighs
Askin' me if she can ride
Like what you think girl? Hop on in
Pick the hole and I'll drive it in
Floored the gas we slippin' slidin'
Paintin' that truck behind us
Uh! Oh!

I'm living life my way
Full throttle down the highway
Leaving behind what's behind me
Living like I can't die
Chasing another sunrise
I'm living life my way
A full throttle down the high-high-way-ay-ay
If today is my last day
Know that I died alive
Ride into the sunrise

When the day gets dark and the lights go out
And I'm looking back on everything I've lost
Trying to figure out what this life's about
Doubt hits hard like a 12 gauge
Stuck in the muck of my old ways
Just trying to get lost in the moment
And forget about the past
Because the past is like a damn cage
Be a man that can stand when the times right
Be you, be true in the limelight
But my thoughts are lost with each shot, so rocked
And still shocked by the view in my hindsight
Walking tall through hell so steady
But still living 'cause hell wasn't ready
Everything in the past is so heavy
So you know I stay high like a jacked up Chevy
There's nothing better than finally letting go like
The world is mine and I was born a drifting soul, right
A little whiskey and an open road
Riding through the night, chasing another sunrise

I'm living life my way
Full throttle down the highway
Leaving behind what's behind me
Living like I can't die
Chasing another sunrise
I'm living life my way
A full throttle down the high-high-way-ay-ay
If today is my last day
Know that I died alive
Ride into the sunrise

When the sun goes down and the drinks go around
And I'm thinking back on everything I've lost
The view from up top ain't bad looking down
Another day another State Line
I'm done letting the Devil try and take mine
Living life one city at a time
Just tipping back that moonshine
'Cause the pain is so constant
But enough is enough with the nonsense
All the women and the drugs and the violence
Weighing like a million-one tons on my conscience
So it I put it in a bag of bones
Then park my wheels, like that I'm home
Then stop
Put the pedal to the metal when I wake up in the morning then I'm gone
There's nothing better than finally letting go like
The world is mine and I was born a drifting soul, right
A little whiskey and an open road
Riding through the night, chasing another sunrise

I want to die, I want to die, I want to die
Put the world to my back and ride
I want to die, I want to die, I want to die
Put the world to my back and ride

I'm living life my way
Full throttle down the highway
Leaving behind what's behind me
Living like I can't die
Chasing another sunrise
I'm living life my way
A full throttle down the high-high-way-ay-ay
If today is my last day
Know that I died alive
Ride into the sunrise

I'm living like I'll never die (never die)
Cigarette ashes blowing through the night (through the night)
I put the world to my back and just ride
No regrets, I just want to die alive
I lean back and just let it go
Like everything in the past is old
You can put it on my mama I'm a drifting soul
And these tires been through plenty hell before
I been there, I done that
I'm done with that, ain't looking back
Now it's nothing but my way and the highway

I'm living life my way
Full throttle down the highway (highway)
Leaving behind what's behind me
Living like I can't die
Chasing another sunrise
I'm living life my way (my way)
A full throttle down the high-high-way-ay-ay (highway)
If today is my last day
Know that I died alive
Ride into the sunrise

I want to die, I want to die, I want to die
Put the world to my back and ride
I want to die, I want to die, I want to die
Put the world to my back and ride"

Still splittin' sticks, I run the farm in this truck (yeah)
And in the woods C-Hubb will get that buck, I ain't stuck in a rut

Got my fishin' line by my two mile road hidden in them pines
'Til we finally find the bonfire and them country folk
There's plenty beer and a water hole, so we drinkin' swingin' off the rope
We grillin' up some chicken wings
There's daisy dukes on them pretty things
Ain't everybody met yet but we all reppin' Tiller Gang (Yeah)
Picture that, we in the woods, way off the map
And if we finish off the beer, good thing I brought this fifth of Jack

I roll, I ride, just got a brand new tiller bow
I can, survive, a country boy with the 4-wheel drive
And the lake, is live, got the catfish jumpin' out that bitch
Now cast, a line, gotta tell ya how I live just one more time
At the Franklin County small engine, I holler at ole' Joe Owens
Yeah he knows them damn motors, 'bouta get my mower goin'
Like the Tennessee river we flow, plant seed now watch it grow
Turn on the grill and watch it smoke, drink cold beer while chillin' on the boat
(Here we go) One more time, let me see y'all crank them tines
Crack that jack, kick them raps, yeah unwind like a ball of twine!
Now who am I? Fatt Tarr, got the shine in the jar
Shoulda been president now go get me my damn guitar
Hell, don't make me tell you twice
Cause this buzz got me feelin' nice
Got the coolers, got the grill
And Bigg Johns bouta get the ice

Blue check now they hang around for an image
I don't need fake love, now bitch you can end it

Gonna tell ya little somethin' 'bout a place I like

But we been on the road doin' shows
So, it's been a little hard missin' home
Been gone so long that I feel alone
I can't help how I feel, when I miss the place
I used to get a buzz off just a case
But, everything has changed
The Jawga Boyz have made a name
But I can't complain 'cause I love the fans
I love signin' shirts and love shakin' hands
And you hear how a song that I wrote
Helped them in life when nothin' was goin' right
Now it's time for me to go home
Light the bonfire and play this song


And now we're chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh

Everything's been so hectic since we been gone
But now we're back baby, home sweet home
Back in the land of the brotherhood
With my rednecks and homies and it's all good
Down by the creek, where the water flows cold
Same ol' stuff and it never gets old
Chillin' by the fire while your stories get told
And if we get bored then we hit a dirt road
I know where to go just to find my soul
And ya dig real deep in a big mud hole
Maybe take my son out with a fishin' pole
When ya in the backwoods that's how ya roll
So I'ma take it slow and be a simple man
'Cause at the end of the day, that's all I am
Spendin' time with my fam on all my land
And I'll pop this top and I'll play this jam

And now we're chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh

And the sound of a southern rock guitar lick
Raised on country, southern rock
But I always loved a little hip hop
And we throw it down for miles around
Everybody knows when to come
When the bonfire's blazin' high, you can't deny
We're 'bout to have some fun
Got the trucks backed up
With the tailgates down, no cops around
We sippin' shine here, I don't mind
Take a swig of this and lets shoot some signs
Yeah, no place that I'd rather be
Ain't nobody else that I'd rather see
So now it's time for us to unwind
Play that song for me one mo' time

First you need a 808
Mix a little mandolin with the guitar and some bass
Let them high hats run and then release with a snare
And a sick kick drum then you're almost there
All you need now, the hardest part
The most important ingredient in this mixed up art
A country boy with a rap flow like a river
Someone that's good with his rhymes and knows how to deliver
That magic, lyrics sound so automatic
The way I'm choppin' up words like a grammatical hatchet
I'm an addict, baby I'm addicted to music and
Just like a drug I get turned up when I use it
Let me introduce you to beast mode
Pullin' this trigger 'til it's empty then I reload
Gettin' krunk but it ain't champagne in the glass
Here let me let the man explain it to your ass

It's a little George Strait, it's a little T-Pain
It's a little 2Pac, chillin' on a front porch swing
It's a little Biggie Smalls, with a Garth Brook's twang
It ain't rap, it ain't country
It's a hick-hop thang

It's your boy D. Thrash, yeah
They say a redneck shouldn't try to rap
But some of you folks should wake up from your nap
'Cause we've been in the sticks out here kickin' the door in
Long before this hick-hop was a trend
And now you got folks tryin' to jump from the bandwagon
Sand baggin' after shows fan braggin'
Everybody tryin' to come up with a cool name
But we know it's still a hick-hop thang

It's a little George Strait, it's a little T-Pain
It's a little 2Pac, chillin' on a front porch swing
It's a little Biggie Smalls, with a Garth Brooks twang
It ain't rap, it ain't country
It's a hick-hop thang

Yeah, we keep it bumpin' in the sticks
We're some hicks with a love for hip-hop
We loud in the woods, stereos and big blocks
A lot of folks around my way they love and they hate it
But I was stayin' up too late and rappin' and workin' on my cadence
From a snotty nose youngin' and strummin' started hummin' verses
Nervous on the surface right hander with a purpose
Verdict caught up and addicted to the rhythm and the flow
And never could I think about livin' out of the country though
And mix a little Conway Twitty and then some Biggie
Strum a little Diddy gritty lyrics but they always witty
Pretty city boys admitin' that these country boys are flowin'
And yeah, we mix it all in this hip-hop potion
Now these folks drinkin' it up, we syncin' it up
This rappin' country on the rise and we bringin' it up
And while I'm sellin' this rebellion now they thinkin' I'm a felon
So when they ask me to explain the type of music I do I tell 'em

It's a little George Strait, it's a little T-Pain
It's a little 2Pac, chillin' on a front porch swing
It's a little Biggie Smalls, with a Garth Brooks twang
It ain't rap, it ain't country
It's a hick-hop thang"

Wild out of you want
Take that shot, hit this blunt
Go head
It's all on you, eyes glued to the view
By the way you move, Go head
Stomp a dance floor route, hands up, drinks up 'bout to tear it all down, Go head
DJs spinnin' them hits
I could tell she want more how she swingin' them hips
Go head
You can wear my Ray Bands
When your eyes blood shoot that's the game plan
No complaints sittin' in my deer stand
From a hundred yards bet you could hit a beer can

Go head show 'em how to work them curves
Drop it down to the dirt (To the dirt)
Go head
Not givin' a damn (Nope), turnin' them heads, knockin' 'em dead
Go head dance on the bar with your glass up
Always showin' up lookin' top shelf
Go head
Let 'em know ya, make 'em want ya, wish they had ya
So go head

Sing along with me in the front cab
Cheech and Chong installed the glass pack
Not much longer til we get to the back tracks
High on this  don't mind the red tags
I'm comin' through with that Lenny Coop jet black
Swooped up on the bullet proof chest vest
32s calibrated like a chess set
Custom goose chrome hitch
Greens up in the head rests
Go head let me see you do work, girl
Get a little dirty go and make it hurt, girl
Hair down in my old T-Shirt, girl
Take it off and we can take it to church girl
The way you movin' it when you get into it
Girl you got-got-got me like Lord have mercy
Type of girl you wanna put a ring on
Wanna bring home 

Go head show 'em how to work them curves
Drop it down to the dirt (To the dirt)
Go head
Not givin' a damn (Nope), turnin' them heads, knockin' 'em dead
Go head dance on the bar with your glass up
Always showin' up lookin' top shelf
Go head
Let 'em know ya, make 'em want ya, wish they had ya
So go head"

Church

Sometimes I get stoned in my backyard
Lay off in the tall grass, so my view is of stars
I think about nothin', get to clear my thoughts
From all the thunder and lightnin' so I feel a spark
Sometimes I get higher than the Colorado Rockies
Hopin' that the county sheriff don't stop me
Like Charlie Daniels said, you shouldn't smoke that dope
But damn it I can't help, I love rollin' stoned

With the windows rolled down and the radio up
Sweet tea full in my Solo cup
Listenin' to the hummin' of the 44's
Soundin' like a concert out my beat up doors
Arm hangin' out the window, smile and a wave
Smokin' on some grown where the cattle graze
Charlie Daniels said you shouldn't go smoke that dope
But, hell, I can't help I love rollin' stoned
Yeah, I love rollin' stoned

Smoke rollin' 'round the cab with the dome light on
Lookin' like a stage for a Lynyrd Skynyrd song
Hangin' out with Mary Jane but she's makin' the time go slow
Makin' memories with my buddies through the thick green smoke
Puff passin' out the windows of my old Tahoe
Lifted so damn high I can't come down
Drivin' under the speed limit in my town

With the windows rolled down and the radio up
Sweet tea full in my Solo cup
Listenin' to the hummin' of the 44's
Soundin' like a concert out my beat up doors
Arm hangin' out the window, smile and a wave
Smokin' on some grown where the cattle graze
Charlie Daniels said you shouldn't go smoke that dope
But hell, I can't help, I love rollin' stoned
Yeah, I love rollin' stoned

There ain't nothin' like the swayin' of a windy back road
Baked out like a barn full of tobacco
I know Jesus drank wine but I bet he wouldn't mind
Sittin' with me in my Chevy pass it around a few times

With the windows rolled down, the radio up
Sweet tea full in our Solo cups
Listenin' to the hummin' of the 44's
Like a concert out my beat up doors
Arm hangin' out the window, smile and a wave
Smokin' on some grown where the cattle graze
Ol' Willie said there's not nothin' wrong with smokin' dope
So light one up and let's go rollin' stoned
So pass me that and let's start rollin' stoned"

I’m sending shots at everybody, let the hatred begin
I’m really livin' how I’m spittin', I ain’t living pretend
I’m 'bout to shit on everyone that ever doubted I’d win

Came out the trailer, mama shoulda whooped my ass
I was six when I found a .38 in the grass
And I tucked that bitch up in my waist right fast
And then I promise if they try me I will blast

Motherfucker, I’m reckless
Someone put a bounty on my necklace
I’m trying to leave these horsemen headless
Livin' life stress less
Smokin' joints and playin' with the bestest
She tell me that she love me and she said that I’m the bestest

Yeah, I’m just vibin'
There’s haters in the city when I’m walkin'
If they try me I'ma put 'em in a coffin
Ain’t no yellin', ain’t no talkin
Fire on me, ain’t afraid to spark 'em
And I’m handlin' myself so I don’t even gotta fuck a bitch up

Had to take a second to breathe
I’m fat as fuck and out of breath, I swear you wouldn’t believe
Guess the rest is for the best, and yes the bestest is me
I got the hammer on my waist, so I’m content as could be

And I promise, it’s just another day up in the office
Bitch, I’m sick, I’m bout to spit and make 'em vomit
Motherfucker, I promise, it’s just another day up in the office

Baby, she gotta be country made
Yeah, yeah, grew up off collards and yams
Just enough junk in the trunk like bam and a tan for days
Damn straight I can tell she's country made
(Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)

Country made like some collard and gritts
Talkin' deep down south, 'bout as good as it gets you know
Them shorty shorts that make the cheeks of her butt show
Got a country boy like whoa
They don't make 'em like this in the city
She can hunt, she can fish, and she still look pretty
Looks cute in them boots and he shows no pity
And she by my side 'til the real nitty gritty
Made me wanna call her mama say thank you ma'am
Drink a beer with her daddy and shake his hand
She ain't gotta wear a dress to impress me
Blue jeans, t-shirt, Realtree
Around her I can always be the real me
I make a man get down on one knee
Look her in the eyes ask her ""What's it gonna be""
Anything that you need, girl it's on me

(Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)

Her daddy taught her right, taught her how to load a gun (Yeah)
How to fish and hunt, and how to get a job done
Known to get her hands dirty, hair up in a bun
And she stays lookin' fine, man I swear like she's the one
She's bangin', (She bangin') but she made me go straight
Think about her while I'm on the road and I'm away
She give me my own space she know I gotta get paid
'Cause she really likes spendin' all the money that I made
But I'm straight, 'cause we make a lot of change
Ridin' like we're Bonnie and Clyde in our own lane
She my ride or die and it goes both ways
Got me listenin' to that Lonestar, baby I'm amazed, uh
If she want it she can get it
Country as a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken
Butter on the biscuits, all of the fixin's
Finger lickin' and I'm about to dig in

Everything we do, we do it outback
Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
Everywhere we go, we go to the back
Backyard bars serving jars full of batch
Back under the moon with the tailgate back
In back of the saloon where the jukebox at

Fatt Tarr on the track and we tiltin' back
We out behind the Exit Inn drinkin' beer with The Lacs
We up in Nashville y'all better tell the haters relax
So we can get a little wild, crack a bottle of Jack
But I ain't 'bout that
I just want to kick it with the women
Blow a little smoke and if they like it then I'm winnin'
To the gang up in this sta-a-a-ck they want it come and get it
'Cause we out here makin' friends we still livin' independent

Like the Declaration, that we live by
It's a celebration, let the flag fly
Bring your kids even your mama and them
Homie rubbin' the ribs
Throw 'em in the smoke
And we swim
Float in the river with friends
At it again
Somebody give me the Jim
Cali and Tennessee gettin' it in
Drinkin', eatin', yell
'Til we drunk and full as Hell man
So we'll be chillin' where the cows at
If that's a problem for you we can take it outback

Everything we do, we do it outback
Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
Everywhere we go, we go to the back
Backyard bars serving jars full of batch
Back under the moon with the tailgate back
In back of the saloon where the jukebox at

Bubba K's back, in here to be exact
Got a Betty with some back
Acting bad as she can act
And we throwin' back a few, but I ain't really keeping track
Now her man's back and I'll be easin' back
Yes, sir, he can have her
I was briefly caught up in the rapture
Now I'm back in a sorta same mind-frame
Funny thing how it happened when the time came
I was in the back drinkin' with the Bandits
And the Jawga Boyz, just like I planned it
Then she walked in, then she walked back out
Then she walked back in, look at that, ""Wow""
I couldn't back down, so I stood tall
Tried to play it cool, you think I could? Naw
And just as we was headin' back to the house
Back walkin' in? Yup, there comes her spouse (I'm out)

Everything we do, we do it outback
Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
Everywhere we go, we go to the back
Backyard bars serving jars full of batch
Back under the moon with the tailgate back
In back of the saloon where the jukebox at

Outback where the forest is thick
There's a circle in the middle of a field, where a bonfire's lit
Cup full of shine, Copenhagen in my lip
Now I'm dippin' sideways, probably wake up in a ditch
So, crank that music into the night
And crack that beer and raise it high
Stacked little blonde want a midnight ride
Take her back to the country for a real good time

Everything we do, we do it outback
Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
Everywhere we go, we go to the back
Backyard bars serving jars full of batch
Back under the moon with the tailgate back
In back of the saloon where the jukebox at

Got me steppin' in manure every time I spit shit
Feel like Cash in the photo with the bird gettin' flipped
Came from the bottom, so they labeled me a catfish
Worldwide, better grab you an Atlas
Bonfire lit like Willy, let's smoke
Rack full ribs and a smoker full of oak
Blackberry Brandy, out back in the duck blind
Black Lab runnin', got huntin' in his bloodlines
Came from outback, but I'm back in the lead
Back like a rack full of fat double Ds
Back with a barrel on a rack, let me squeeze
Back on the trigger, hit 'er right between the knees
Back with the tow strap I pull 'em real heavy
Ladies gettin' dirty outback on the Chevy
Dive-bar beauty queen, Bubba call 'em 'Betties'
Pedal to the metal, baby girl, I'm ready

I sent a text to Tex, and Bird called me back
He said 'We All Country', and I said, 'Yeah, that's a fact'
Well, now it's 'Rebels on the Run', time ya better pack
We 'bout to hit the road, rock shows and make a stack
I folded up my clothes, loaded up my click-clack
Grabbed a can of Beard Commander, throwed it all in a sack
I caught a fly in A-Town, landed out in Sac
The bus pulled up, it was big and it was black
That Detroit Diesel was roaring like a Mack
Had chrome around the bottom, it was shiny like a plaque
I climbed on up, sat down to relax
But I heard a lot of ruckus it was coming from the back

Everything we do, we do it outback
Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
Everywhere we go, we go to the back
Backyard bars serving jars full of batch
Back under the moon with the tailgate back
In back of the saloon where the jukebox at

Talkin' 'bout a burn pile, hound dog, me and my honey
We can run a game of shoes, we can lose a little money
Might talk a little smack, after sippin' that Jack
Bunch of jacked up trucks all parked 'round back
Yeah, get loose, like they do it up in Cali
Ol' shine so smooth, like you cruisin' in a Caddy
Then we rolled ourself a fatty, went around to the shed
I had to back up off it, it was buzzin' my head

See I'm back in the Mac, I'm in the back with The Lacs
Get on these backs to the Sacs
Know how I'm hackler's act
See I'm partyin' to death, with Bacardi on my breath
I'm thinking naughty to myself about the shawty on my left
Yeah, we're still outback
It's the country outcasts
Thinkin' you can out-rap?
Yeah, bitch, I doubt that
Meet us all out back
And we'll whoop that loud ass
'Cause were bringin' country back, quicker than a snap-back

And you can find us outback, makin' shine
You want to taste-test? Then get in line
Yeah, we keep the grill fired up, and I keep a camouflage mud jug
Some folks want to hate on us but
We can take it out back if you want some
Back Road ridin', with the hat back
Drink in my lap, in a brown paper sack
My cell phone won't get no service
I'm cool, but city folks get nervous
'Cause they ain't never been out here
No streetlights, and we eat deer
I'm either in the backyard or the backwoods, and I'm livin' good (Ha ha)

That old water tower smack dab in the middle of town
One time I was gonna spray paint a big green pot plant on that
Then I sobered up and I looked around and I couldn't believe what I seen
All my buddies grew up, had babies and a wife, but one of them buddies ain't me

'Cause I'm still ridin' around this town
Still blarin' the same old songs
Still tryna find a spot where the cops don't park
So, I can get my Willie Nelson on
I still stay lit like a county fair
Sweeter than a jug of Milo's tea
Yeah, your buddies might have moved out their own hometown
But one of them buddies ain't me

Nah, it ain't me
Nah, it ain't me
Nah, it ain't me
Nah, it ain't me

They say buy a lift kit 'cause now you're rich
But that's not my frame of mind
I still trim the bumper off in the front
Just to fit my 35's
I got the tread still hummin' down cracked asphalt
Singin', ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""
And I still love seein' that hometown line
Says, ""Welcome to Tennessee""

And I'll be ridin' around this town
Still blarin' your favorite songs
I'll be sittin' in a spot where the cops ain't parked
Gettin' my Ryan Upchurch on

'Cause the liquor never do me wrong
She gon' ride for me all night long
She gon' ride on me while she singing my song
She gon' ride on me all night long
'Cause the liquor never do me wrong

Does she, does she know she wanna call right back?
Think I might hit it like I'm never coming back
Knew shе was the one hopping out the Cadillac
Had to doublе-take 'cause girl that ass is looking fat
Take a ride, take a ride wit' me
I give you all the pearls and the diamond rings
Girl, I'm too far gone, I'm a lone ranger
It's time for me to find myself the perfect stranger
All long, finna get it
I've been looking for a minute
Had to go and get a penny to find out what I'm missing
Girl, you so pretty, didn't know that I needed
Now I'm falling for an angel, girl, you got me so heated

Oh, ooh-oh
Baby girl, won't you come and take a ride with me
Oh, ooh-oh
Oh-oh

She gon' ride for me all night long
She gon' ride on me while she singing my song
She gon' ride on me all night long
'Cause the liquor never do me wrong
She gon' ride for me all night long
She gon' ride on me while she singing my song
She gon' ride on me all night long
'Cause the liquor never do me wrong

Baby girl, you got me high up
Go and take a ride in this six-speed driving downtown tonight
Got my hopes up high and my head down low
Baby, welcome to the rodeo
I don't expect you to fall in love
I need a one night stand, nothing permanent
Someone to hold my hand, I hope you understand
But when the liquor talk, we gon' ride 'til the sun come up
Wait a minute, had to go and get it, yeah
She wasn't playing, girl, that booty had me thinking, yeah
Hot damn, I ain't felt this in a minute, yeah
Come on, baby girl, take a ride with me

Oh, ooh-oh
Baby girl, won't you come and take a ride with me
Oh, ooh-oh
Oh-oh

She gon' ride (She gon' ride) for me all night long
She gon' ride (She gon' ride) on me while she singing my song
She gon' ride (She gon' ride) on me all night long
'Cause the liquor never do me wrong (It never do me wrong)
She gon' ride for me all night long
(Wait a minute, had to go and get it, yeah)
She gon' ride on me while she singing my song
(She wasn't playing, girl, that booty had me thinking, yeah)
She gon' ride on me all night long
(Hot damn, I ain't felt this in a minute, yeah)
'Cause the liquor never do me wrong
(Come on, baby girl, take a ride with me)
(It never do me wrong)"

We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high

Jawga Boyz we ridin' high, we back in the jacked up trucks
Ridin' on 44's mud on the doors and our plan is to get stuck
On the phone call up the boys
Let them all know to bring them toys
Got a wench on the front if you need tow
And straight pipes that make some noise, yeah
We comin' from a mile away you can hear them roar
Got knobby tires we ridin' higher than we ever did before
If you wanna a ride then I got to say hop in at your discretion
'Cause some have told me that these seats are in the nose bleed section
Got a 12 gauge on the back glass and it's ready to go
When I am on the road I never know when I'll see a buck or a doe
Dip in my lip, and a cup of spit in the middle console
Still gettin' hunnies and scarin' bunnies you already know (Haha)
So this truck, gonna keep on rollin' down the road
And it ain't no joke, 'cause the Jawga Boyz are good as gold
So take some notes when you hear the flow
And see the mud hangin' on the door
My truck ain't slow and it ain't for show, 'cause
We jack 'em up and then we

Ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high

Deep down in the woods (yep) high like the trees (yep)
A bunch of rednecks who don't have no damn degrees
I'm reppin' for the sticks, I'm reppin' for us hicks
I'm talkin' about us folks who ain't never seen rich
My Chevy truck is jacked up, a mud hole make me act up
I snatch it tight and stack up, I'm slingin' mud y'all back up
It's true it ain't no lie, my Chevy's high on 45's
Cruisin' DUI, you know I'm sippin' apple pie
Got that wheelie, rompin' loud, black and camo on my ride
Yeah that Georgia flag flies 'cause I'm known to show my pride
Yeah we creep and we crawl, country clique yellin' ""yee haw""
Yeah I've had some slips and falls, due to too much alcohol
Yeah my truck sits tall, sayin' I'm scarin' at the focus
Grippin' mud and climbin' rocks still can't find a way to roll it
Now I'm with these Jawga Boyz and we ridin' tonka toys
With them big trucks, big tires, we jack 'em up and then we

Ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high

44's, big trucks, camo paint, big bucks
Nuts on my truck hitch, I'm draggin' them in the mud ruts
Just some 'ol country boys, high like the pine trees
And you can bet this be the last of a dying breed
Southern blood, runs through my veins we some rebel boys
Cross the river you ain't heard Bottleneck and them Jawga Boyz
Comin' through on the tonka toys ridin' high and jacked up
Slangin' mud, lock the hubs, we got that mack cuz
Rawdog in the Georgia Clay jacked up is how we play
This is how we do it buck we keep 'em southern raised
Stuck in our southern ways, stayin' in the desperate days
We ridin' high and jack em up they ain't no other way
Better grip that steerin' wheel gonna make that Chevy squeel
True gritty country boys, hick life, you know it real
We on that southern grind, we jacked up all the time
We ridin' in the sky, we jack 'em up and then we

Ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
We jack 'em up and then we ridin' high
Yeah we riding high!"
