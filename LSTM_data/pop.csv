Morgan Wallen (Tradução em Português) Lyrics

Você tem muita coragem, não tem, querida?
Eu só encho a cara porque você me faz fazer isso
Você 'tá dizendo pra todos os seus amigos que eu sou louco
Como se eu fosse o único
Por que você os apedrejaria se você
Tinha um ou dois grandes desejos?
Morando nessa grande casa de vidro com uma bela visão
Eu achei que você sabia que

Eu tive ajuda
Não é como se eu pudesse fazer toda essa bagunça por conta própria
Não aja como se você não tivesse me ajudado a puxar a garrafa pra fora da prateleira
Estive bem envolvido em todo final de semana, se não percebeu
Eles dizem, ""Trabalho em equipe faz o sonho acontecer""
É lógico que eu tive ajuda (Ajuda)

(Ajuda)

Você achou que eu levaria a culpa por termos terminado
Ande por aí como se você não fosse a culpada de algo
Já perdeste o jogo que esteve fugindo
Parece que está te alcançando, né
Você acha que é tão inocente
Depois de toda a merda que fez
Eu não sou um anjo, você não é enviada dos céus
Não consigo nos tirarmos disso

Eu tive ajuda
Não é como se eu pudesse fazer toda essa bagunça por conta própria
Não aja como se você não tivesse me ajudado a puxar a garrafa pra fora da prateleira
Estive bem envolvido em todo final de semana, se não percebeu
Eles dizem, ""Trabalho em equipe faz o sonho acontecer""
É lógico que eu tive ajuda (Ajuda)

(Ajuda)
(Ajuda)
(Ajuda)

É necessário dois pra quebrar um coração no meio, ooh
Querida, você me põe a culpa e, querida, eu ponho a culpa em você
Aw, se não for essa a verdade (Oh)

Eu tive ajuda
Não é como se eu pudesse fazer toda essa bagunça por conta própria
Não aja como se você não tivesse me ajudado a puxar a garrafa pra fora da prateleira
Estive bem envolvido em todo final de semana, se não percebeu
Eles dizem, ""Trabalho em equipe faz o sonho acontecer""

We had a plan, move out of this town, baby
West to the sand, it's all we talked about lately
I'd pack the car, bring your guitar and Jane for smokin'
First thing at dawn, you'd queue the songs and we'd get goin'
But you weren't home, waited on the porch for ya
Sat there alone, all throughout the morn' 'til I
Got a hunch down in my gut and snuck around the back
Empty cans and I'll be damned, your shit was never packed

Did your boots stop workin'? Did your truck break down? (Truck break down)
Did you burn through money? Did your ex find out? (Ex find out)
Where there's a will, then there's a way, and I'm damn sure you lost it
Didn't even say goodbye, just wish I knew what caused it
Was the whiskey flowin'? Were you in a fight? (In a fight)
Did the nerves come get you? What's your alibi? (Alibi)
I made my way back to LA, and that's where you'll be forgotten
In forty years, you'll still be here, drunk washed up in Austin

Hell of a bluff, you had me believin'
How many months did you plan on leavin'?
What happened? Bad habits?
Did you go back? Go batshit?
I loved you, how tragic, oh-oh

Did your boots stop workin'? Did your truck break down? (Truck break down)
Did you burn through money? Did your ex find out? (Ex find out)
Where there's a will, then there's a way, and I'm damn sure you lost it
Didn't even say goodbye, just wish I knew what caused it
Was the whiskey flowin'? Were you in a fight? (In a fight)
Did the nerves come get you? What's your alibi? (Alibi)
I made my way back to LA, and that's where you'll be forgotten

I know you're worried at night, I won't find my way
And I'm tired of lyin' to myself just to get through each day
My head says, ""I shoulda never left""
And that my feet will soon lead to my death

I'm startin' to question
If God's tryna teach me a lesson
I'm startin' to wonder
If my true colors changed since I left ya

I used to shine bright like gold, now I'm all indigo
My colors are darker and cold, I think it's time that I went home
And I don't understand why I always feel dead and alone
Well, I used to shine bright like gold, now I'm all indigo

I gave up a piece of my heart, then I turned to run
Oh, my head's in the clouds, but I don't feel close to the sun
And the light fades away from my face, and the tears fall like rain
So I turn my words all into faith, hope it's me that they save

Oh, I'm startin' to question
If God's tryna teach me a lesson
Lord knows I'm startin' to wonder
If my true colors changed since I left ya

I used to shine bright like gold, now I'm all indigo
My colors are darker and cold, I think it's time that I went home
And I don't understand why I always feel dead and alone

I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone, uh

Encontrei um cara pra mirar no meu rifle
O novo namorado da minha mãe reencaderna bíblias
Ricky na estrada, ele arruma as solas dos Red Wings
Droga, eu tenho um cara pra tudo
Oh, isso não é exatamente o que eu 'tô procurando
Porque eu 'tô procurando por

Alguém pra colocar as rodas dela de volta no lugar
E se não fizerem, então eu talvez vá
Perder o que ainda me resta da minha mente nunca amorosa
Estou quase ficando no fundo do poço
Eu sou muito bom em partir um coração
Mas pegar os pedaços é a parte mais difícil
Ela está buscando por alguém bom que irá reconstrui-lo de novo
Mas eu não encontrei um cara pra isso

Não encontrei um cara pra isso, não encontrei um cara pra isso
Não encontrei um cara pra isso

Conheço um VIP no MIT
E ele ainda não me deixa pilotar a máquina do tempo
Alguém que faça recuar os ponteiros do meu novo AP
Mas, amigo, o que eu realmente preciso

É de alguém pra colocar as rodas dela de volta no lugar
E se não fizerem, então eu talvez vá
Perder o que ainda me resta da minha mente nunca amorosa
Estou quase ficando no fundo do poço
Eu sou muito bom em partir um coração
Mas pegar os pedaços é a parte mais difícil
Ela está buscando por alguém bom que irá reconstrui-lo de novo
Mas eu não encontrei um cara pra isso

Não encontrei um cara pra isso, não encontrei um cara pra isso (Cara pra isso)

New truck, big lift
Old roads, we've been
Tearin' up since way back when
But these wheels are innocent
New hitch, new seats, no history
And you just can't fake that
So, let's change that

Girl, let's go put some miles on it

Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in if you know what I mean

All night, no brakes
All tail, no gate
Ain't gotta try too hard
My baby's push to start
All torque, full speed
Off-road, on me
Zero to a hundred fast
My foot ain't touch the gas
I said, ""Hey, baby, slow it down, let's make it last""
You said, ""Where's the fun in that?""

Yeah, let's go, put some miles on it

Mile after mile after mile after mile
Turn up the night like that radio dial
Shoulder to shoulder where nobody knows
Know where we're goin', we ain't goin' home

Sayin' everything under the moon
To get you into my arms tonight
You probably heard it all a thousand times
But it ain't what it looks like
Girl, let me tell you what it looks like

You look like waves on a sunset
And you can crash on me all night
You look like wine in a truck bed
A little what I'm doin' for the rest of my life 'cause
You look like I'm done lookin'
But girl the hard truth is
If this night don't turn into two
You look like I'm gonna wind up missin' you

I gotta tell you, baby, I've been
The kind of boy your daddy never wanted
You to go and fall in love with
The kinda boys you're probably done with their dumb shit, yeah
I bet you heard the stories and
Can't say I'm proud of that, but
I've turned the page on the old me
And now I ain't lookin' back 'cause

You look like waves on a sunset
And you can crash on me all night
And you look like wine in a truck bed
A little what I'm doin' for the rest of my life 'cause
You look like I'm done lookin'
But girl the hard truth is
If this night don't turn into two
You look like I'm gonna wind up missin'

Missin' you in the mornin'
Probably for the next few years
When I look back on it
I'll still see you right here

You look like waves on a sunset
And you can crash on me all night
And you look like wine in a truck bed
A little what I'm doin' for the rest of my life 'cause
You look like I'm done lookin'
But girl the hard truth is
If this night don't turn into two
You look like I'm gonna wind up missin' you

Wind up missin' you
Wind up missin' you"

I check my pulse and my heart's still beatin'
Exhale I think I'm still breathin'
Both feet on the ground, but something's changed
I've been playin' less Black Keys, baby
And my friends swear I've gone crazy
I don't know how to act, I don't know what to say

'Cause, oh, my God, he walked in
Like a 6'2'' dream Heaven sent
He says what he means, and he means what he says
And he's funny and he's smart
And he's good in — (Good in — )
Maybe love ain't always what it was
Not cryin' and dyin', and messin' me up
I think I'm really happy, I think I wanna stay
Oh, my God, am I okay?

Who knew guys still brought flowers
Or picked up the phonе before a last call hour?
And not 'cause thеy cheated, and not 'cause they lied
And not 'cause they're sorta sorry after a fight
And wait, there's guys that can communicate
That aren't lookin' for a heart to break
Always thought hell no, no way

And then, oh, my God, he walked in
Like a 6'2'' dream Heaven sent
He says what he means, and he means what he says
And he's funny and he's smart
And he's good in — (Good in — )
Maybe love ain't always what it was
Not cryin' and dyin', and messin' me up
I think I'm really happy, I think I wanna stay
Oh, my God, am I okay?

I don't feel like a sad song soundtrack
The old me doesn't know how to feel about that
Am I okay? I think I'm okay

'Cause, oh, my God, he walked in
Like a 6'2'' dream Heaven sent
He says what he means, and he means what he says
And he's funny and he's smart
And he's good in — (Good in — )
Maybe love ain't always what it was
Not cryin' and dyin', and messin' me up
I think I'm really happy, I think I wanna stay
Oh, my God, am I okay?

That beer ain't gettin' any colder

And I ain't sayin' he's a bad guy, all I know is that guy

So maybe we should

Call each other, blame it on another ""it's late""
Girl, I wonder, should we make another mistake?
Under covers, I say I'm recovered
I'd change that in a heartbeat just to feel your body

Ever fallin' in love with a guy like me in the first place
Then turn around, say that I'm the worst thing?

I guess I'm the problem
And you're Ms. ""Never Do No Wrong""
If I'm so awful
Then why'd you stick around this long?
And if it's the whiskey
Then why you keep on pullin' it off the shelf?
You hate that when you look at me, you halfway see yourself
And it got me thinkin'

We try to go our sеparate ways
And we're back and forth likе a swingin' door
And tomorrow's like yesterday
Some days better than the night before
And you're back to me again
Then you go and tell your friends

Girl, I meant what I said
When I said, ""I do.""
Yeah, through thick or thin
I'd spend forever with you
But if I leave this world
Baby, a little too soon
It hurts like hell to say, ""I hope you find someone new.""

He can have my truck, sitting out in the drive
He can have this house, everything inside
My favorite fishing hole and my old dog too
But what he'll never have is the love I have for you

Girl, I hope and pray
You and me grow old
Few lines on our face
Few million stories told
But if I leavе this place
Find another hand to hold
It hurts like hеll to say, but make sure he knows

He can have my truck, sitting out in the drive
He can have this house, everything inside
My favorite fishing hole and my old dog too
But what he'll never have is the love I have for you

Hope he's half the man as me
But, baby, there's no way he'll see what I see
He can pile up my stuff or burn it all down
'Cause, girl, your love's all I'll take to the ground

He can have my truck, sitting out in the drive
He can have this house, everything inside
My favorite fishing hole and my old dog too
But what he'll never have is the love I have for you
Have for you"

He's got a Chevrolet that don't always run
And the radio never turns down
He's got a pedigree that's no good for nothing
No commas in his bank account

But there's a girl at the hole in the wall
Where he plays, don't take her eyes off the stage

She loves his southern drawl from north of Atlanta
That Silverado he got parked outside
Loves a cranking '89 Alabama
Kissing for an hour in the parking lot light
Here's to good girls that can't keep from falling
For bad boys that their daddies don't like
Small towns that keep staying small
Here's to old trucks, young love, and Saturday nights

Na-na, na-na, na, na-na, na
Saturday nights
Na-na, na-na, na, na-na, na

As long as pawn shops, sell beat up guitars
To a kid with some hand me down keys
As long as leather jackets
Keep stealing hearts like Elvis and Cash and James Dean

There'll be a girl at the hole in the wall
Where he plays, don't take her eyes off the stage

She loves his southern drawl from north of Atlanta
That Silverado he got parked outside
Loves a cranking '89 Alabama
Kissing for an hour in the parking lot light
Here's to good girls that can't keep from falling
For bad boys that their daddies don't like

Tank of gas, some blue eyes, and some beer in the back
Falling way too fast

For a southern drawl from north of Atlanta
That Silverado he got parked outside
Loves a cranking '89 Alabama
Kissing for an hour in the parking lot light
Here's to good girls that can't keep from falling
For bad boys that their daddies don't like
Small towns that keep staying small
Here's to old trucks, young love, and Saturday nights

Puedo decir que estás enfadado
Y no me sorprende ni la mitad
Desde el día que nos conocimos
Siempre es quién corta primero y nunca quién sangra último
Los rumores siempre se convierten en gritos y peleas
Y una vez que están en tu mente, solo hay una forma de conducir

Lo sé, lo sé
Voy a tomar el camino correcto, nena, colócate
Toma un poco demasiado de algo terrible
Te dejaré que te calmes mientras salgo
No me estás arruinando como las veces anteriores
No necesito una entrada para tu espectáculo de mierda
Date por vencido y toca fondo
Bueno, voy a tomar el camino correcto, tomar el camino correcto, tomar el camino correcto

No quieres hablar de ello, muchacho, no es ninguna sorpresa
Vuelves a casa oliendo a licor como todas las noches
Si te pillo con Ella, me vas a atrapar con él
Crees que no me entero de ello, será mejor que lo pienses de nuevo
Sabes que los rumores siempre se convierten en gritos y peleas
Y una vez que está en mi mente, solo conduzco en una dirección

Lo sabes, lo sé
Tomaré el camino correcto, nena, colócate
Toma un poco demasiado de algo terrible
Dejaré que te calmes mientras salgo
No me estás arruinando como las veces anteriores
No necesito una entrada para tu espectáculo de mierda
Date por vencido y toca un nuevo fondo
Bueno, tomaré el camino correcto, tomaré el camino correcto, tomaré el camino correcto
Whoa, whoa


Tomaré el camino correcto, nena, colócate
Toma un poco demasiado de algo terrible
Dejaré que te calmes mientras salgo
No me estás arruinando como los tiempos anteriores

Want the first taste

So close all the blinds, lock all the doors
Put away anything that'll break

I want you in the worst way

Baby, that don't mean that I
Don't love to go wine and dine you
That ain't on the menu tonight
'Cause I think I need to remind you
That your skin on my skin
Feels just like heaven to me
You look like an angel tonight
But you might wanna slip off those wings

You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
Been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the bordеr and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to bе livin'

See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

I keep chasin' the fire and I keep gettin' burned

The kids are in town for a funeral
So pack the car and dry your eyes
I know they got plenty of young blood left in 'em
And plenty nights under pink skies you taught 'em to enjoy

So clean the house, clear the drawers, mop the floors, stand tall
Like no one's ever been here before or at all
And don't you mention all the inches that are scraped on the doorframe
We all know you tiptoed up to 4'1"" back in '08

If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppiеs
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God hеard you comin'

The kids are in town for a funeral
And the grass all smells the same as the day you broke your arm swingin'
On that kid out on the river
You bailed him out, never said a thing about Jesus or the way he's livin'

If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppies
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God heard you comin'

If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud

Goodbye was the best thing you told me

And, oh, woah

And when I try to write you out, I write you down

Bringing back the best and the worst parts
And when I try to let you go, you still echo
'Cause, baby, you're the ghost in my guitar

Yeah, I wanna smash it like a rockstar in a hotel room
Before I tell it all the things that I can't tell you
I wanna burn it down to ashes in the driveway
Set that shit on fire, babe

I didn't know what I was missin'
Until the second that you walked in
To that bar that night
Under those neon lights
From the moment that you touched me
I was hoping that you'd love me
Forever and ever, for all time

Didn't know that I had been so blind
But you opened my eyes

I was looking more single every single weekend
Looking for a feeling to get my heart beating
Looking for an up all night long
The right kiss, right song
Looking for a sunrise leading to a sunset
Looking for a someone I can spend it with
Then it came around, right out of the blue
And it turns out
Oh, I was looking for you
Yeah, I was looking for you

Couldn't have just been anyone
The way you smiled and said my name
Girl, you were so original
I knew I'd never be the same

I keep on wondering how long you gon' stick around
How many times have I put you through the rain?
And after all the hell, still ain't a ring up on that finger, no

Quarenta horas me fizeram enlouquecer
Os Dallas perderam outro jogo na prorrogação
Levei uma multa por passar dos 65
Não sei onde estou indo

Acho que eu realmente fui e ferrei com tudo de novo
Agora, a minha amada se foi mais do que os ventos de Tulsa
Julgando pelo sóbrio estado em que estou
Eu preciso abrir uma

Alguém me sirva uma bebida, alguém me empresta um cigarro
'Tô prestes a ficar chapado, 'tô prestes a sequenciar vitórias
Sim, estive me esforçando, só acompanhando os Joneses
'Cês sabem o que eu quero dizer, e 'cês sabem como vai
Quando a sexta-feira chega e eu recebo o pagamento, mando uma pra cá
Eu mal consigo pensar quando ouço alguém chamando pelo o meu nome (Ei)

Alguém me sirva uma bebida
Me sirva uma bebida

Os olhos marrons do Bourbon tentam me deixar bêbado
Não vou parar até que a garrafa e o trabalho esteja acabado
Ei, eu acho que talvez tenha encontrado o meu futuro amor
Parceiro, 'cê devia pagar uma pra ela

Alguém me sirva uma bebida, alguém me empresta um cigarro
'Tô prestes a ficar chapado, 'tô prestes a sequenciar vitórias
Sim, estive me esforçando, só acompanhando os Joneses
'Cês sabem o que eu quero dizer, sim, 'cês sabem como vai
Quando a sexta-feira chega e eu recebo o pagamento, mando uma pra cá

Skinny margarita with a broken heart
So I slid over like a steel guitar
We started talkin' 'til I
Saw your boots bounce to the beat
You said, ""Do you dance? Wanna dance with me?""
Next thing I know, I started to think
That we might be onto somethin'

You're puttin' on a show
No need to take it slow
There's something here, I know

I can feel it in the air, feel it in the whiskey in my hand
In your hips, your body tells me when you start to dance
Maybe this is turning to a ""We should probably get up out of here""
Oh, baby, I swear, I can feel it in the air (I can feel it)
I can feel it, mm

You got everybody lookin'
Lookin' at you, lookin' at me
Thеm words you're whisperin' in my ear

And that Lincoln in the driveway, circa 1982
Was on the shiny side of rusty and on the paler side of blue

If every backyard had a garden, every front door had a screen

If every town had a Mamaw's house

She'd ask if I was hungry every thirty seconds
And say things like ""hellfire,"" ""tarnation,"" and ""I reckon's""
It's where I spent my summers and she put me to work
Shellin' peas and shuckin' corn until my fingers hurt

Throwin' up prayers like Hail Marys
If You're still there, Lord, spare me
Oh, my God, oh, my God, Hail Mary

And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer

I went lookin' at pictures I didn't wanna see
They brought back memories
You look happy, I guess, got the life that you wanted
But it ain't with me
You would think by now that I wouldn't care
It's been a couple years and, yeah, I've had my share
Of other broken-up hearts, but I only shed real tears over ours

And now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Prayin' just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me
Religiously

Remember watchin' you play me our song on guitar
I thought I'd marry you
Act like I'm happier now, but all of my friends know
That ain't the truth
And lately life's been good to me
Mama's healthy and I'm helpin' out the whole family
Lotta people know my name, I made a little change
But that don't mean nothin'

'Cause now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Prayin' hard just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me
Religiously

You brought me to God and I put you through hell
You were all about us, I was all about myself
What kind of man would lose a woman like that?
If my soul could be forgiven, I would give it all back

Now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Beggin' God just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously

I ain't got the only woman who was there for me

She talks about the future like she's flippin' through a magazine
Finds the beauty in the thrown away and broken things
Gets excited about all my crazy dreams

Got every sunset that she's ever seen memorized
Saves them away for a rainy day or stormy night
The sky is brighter lookin' at it through her eyes

I don't remember
Life before she came into the picture
Brought the beauty I was missin' with her
Showed me colors I ain't ever seen
She took chances
With every wall I built, she saw a canvas
I thank God every day for how He made her
My life was black and white, but she's the painter

She reminds me that it ain't too late to start again
Fine is good, but you need some blue every now and then
How'd I live so long without her reckless touch?

I don't remember
Life before she came into the picture
Brought the beauty I was missin' with her
Showed me colors I ain't ever seen

I was all but twenty-two, I think at the time
I'd been out on the road lonely at night
And it'd been a while, huh, so it was on my mind
Well, I saw him walk in with his cowboy hat
And I thought to myself, ""I could use some of that""
His boots like glass on a sawdust floor, huh
Had moves like nothin' I'd ever seen before
So I walked right up, and I pulled him to the side
I handed that man a beer and looked him in the eyes
And I said, ""Baby, I think you're gonna wanna hear this""
Then I told him

""Excuse me
You look like you love me
You look like you want me to want you to come on home
And, baby, I don't blame you
For lookin' me up and down across this room
I'm drunk and I'm ready to leavе
And you look like you love me""

Wеll, I was down at a local beer joint with a few of the guys
When this cute little country girl caught my eye
And, boy, let me tell you
She was the prettiest thing I'd ever seen in a pair of boots
Well, she walked right up to me, handed me a beer
Gave me a look like, ""Let's get outta here""
And that's when I realized that she was every cowboy's dream come true
She told me this right here
She said

""Excuse me
You look like you love me
You look like you want me to want you to come on home
And, baby, I don't blame you
For lookin' me up and down across this room
I'm drunk and I'm ready to leave
And you look like you love me""
Alright, now


So if you ever see a man in a cowboy hat
And you think to yourself, ""I could use some of that""
Don't waste your time
Just give him this here line
Goes a little like this

""Excuse me
You look like you love me
You look like you want me to want you to come on home
And, baby, I don't blame you
For lookin' me up and down across this room
I'm drunk and I'm ready to leave
And you look like you love me

Used to pray for rain just to stay inside
You wouldn't believe it, every move I made, I was terrified
Thought that every road I took had a bitter end
I just couldn't see it, I convinced myself tryna trust again
Would be like tryna make a river run upstream
Tryna make a mountain into a valley
That's what your love does to me
You make me feel

Like I never had my heart broken
Like I never saw a door closin'
Like I never watched love run away on fire
In the night like a pack of wild horses
Like I never felt the tears rollin'
Like I never said, ""Here's hopin'""
I could find me someone who's good at bein' real
Who could make me feel wide open
Like I never had my heart

Broken
Broken ('Cause you make me, you make me)
Broken (Uh)
Broken

'Cause you make me, you make me feel
Like I never been too much to handle
Roll the dice, you know love is a gamble
Feel like I always had the poorest example
Like fire in your heart, I'm tryna relight that candle
My Cinderella, no questionin', this shit forever
Pain in written letters, sheddin' tears while we sit together
Forget the pressure, know I love hard, I'm sick of lectures
Stuck in rainstorms, I could get used to this different weather
Broken pieces, that was all I had
Girl, I promise, now you all I got

Like I never had my heart broken
Like I never saw a door closin'
Like I never watched love run away on fire
In the night like a pack of wild horses
Like I never felt the tears rollin'

But she never unlock-locked it, guess I don't live there no more

A camo jacket for a blanket then passed out like I was dead

Every bit of that down-home dirt was heaven on earth
And we never knew it

Yeah, we sure painted it up
Tore down them old two-lane roads
We either stole every sign or left 'em in bullet holes
It wasn't nowhere as bad as we all said that it was
Yeah, looking back at it now this town's been too good to us
Raised hell on the weekends, yeah
Man, what were we thinking when we said we'd leave it in a cloud of dust
This town's been too good to us
Too good to us

Slow like that river rolls
Where that green grass grows
I can't explain it
Aw, it's something ain't it

Oh, God makes the good stuff

Like that sweet little kiss she lays on me
When I pull up in the gravel drive

And I thank Him every time I close my eyes

安物のウイスキーが俺の心を癒してくれる

助手席ではラブラドールがくつろいでいる
君の髪についた砂が俺の目に入ってきて
ビーチのせいにしてくれ　大の男は泣かない
あの壊れた地下室のソファを覚えてるかい？
俺がラブソングを歌っていると君は
君の母さんがどうして指輪を質に入れて出て行ったかを教えてくれるんだ
すべて、すべて覚えているよ

閉店時間の冷え切った態度
君は俺に日が昇るまで一緒に居てほしいと懇願したのに
おかしな言葉が口から零れる
大人の男の心が壊れたときは
写真と過ぎ去った時間
君は飲んでるときだけそんな風に笑うんだ
したくないけど、そうしてしまうよ
君と過ごした夜の、一瞬一秒を思い出す

あなたは心を癒すためなら何でも飲む
でも私の心はいつになったら癒してくれるの？
あなたといると、まるで夏の暑さに熱せられたコンクリートの上を歩いてるようで
二人の魂が出会うとき、それは地獄のように燃え上がる
あなたはあなたがいつも誓っていたような男にはなれないわ
でも、あの88年型フォードで歌うあなたのことを忘れない

閉店時間の冷え切った態度
君は俺に日が昇るまで一緒に居てほしいと懇願したのに
おかしな言葉が口から零れる

We've been swingin’ and missin'
It ain't broke yet, but damn, it needs fixin’
Been a while since your kiss felt like kissin'
It's just different

Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we’re better
Off with all this, but we’re caught in-between

Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
That’s when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mеnds or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place

For thе record (Shit)
Throwin' in the towel takes some effort
So I’d rather ride it out for better weather
Together

Burn from orange to gold
Bought a pawnshop six-string
Sold my soul to rock and roll
They say if you ain't busy livin'
Then you're just dyin' slow
I wanna say I've done it all by the time it's time to go

Where and when and what'll be the death of me
Well, heaven only knows

It might be the highway and it might be these songs
It might be the whiskey or the smoke inside these lungs
Ain't no way around it
One day I'm gonna die
If something's gonna kill me might as well be
What makes me feel alive

I've loved a damn good woman
I've had to let one go
Rode life's rollercoasters
Mountain highs and valley lows
Broke 100 on two wheels
Found revival on the road
The devil's always on my heels but I keep him on his toes

And it might be the highway and it might be these songs

My big brother rode an Indian Scout
It was black like his jacket
American Spirit hangin' outta his mouth
Just like our daddy
He kick-started that bike one night and broke mama's heart
He pointed that headlight West, out where the wild things are

He'd call me up every couple of weeks
From South California
Talk about the desert and the Joshua Tree
And his pretty girl stories
And how he bought an Airstream trailer and a J-45 guitar
Said, ""Little brother, you'd love it out here, out where the wild things are""

Oh, oh-oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, oh-oh, the nights ignite like gasoline
And light up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
Out where the wild things are

I called my brother from the back of that plane
The second I made it
We started drinkin' on the strip in L.A
And then it got crazy
Ended up at a house in the hills with some Hollywood stars
Kissin' on a blonde in a backyard pool, out where the wild things are
(Oh, yeah)

Couple iron horse rebels
Wild as the devil
I knew I had to move back East
Said goodbye to my brother
At the end of that summer
But I knew he'd never leave

Oh, oh-oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, where the nights ignite like gasoline
And oh, oh-oh, them Indian Scouts, man, they're built for speed
And oh, oh-oh, they said he hit that guard rail at half past three
Lit up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
We buried him out in the wind 'neath the West Coast stars
Out where the wild things are

Out where the wild things are"

Spend it all at a jewelry store
Gettin' down on one knee on hеr mama's porch
Just prayin' she don't say, ""No""

Sunburnt on a honeymoon beach and your

And there the next two or three years go

There's a test on the counter, next thing you know
She's standin' there cryin', noddin' her head yes
You're half excited, half scared to death

'Cause next thing you know
You're wearin' scrubs and a funny white hat and the
Doctor's sayin', how you doin' there dad and
Nobody's ever called you that
And you take that drive home slow
Next thing you know
It's first steps, first dates, first car
It's 11:01 wonderin' where they are
You're sayin' that USC's too far
It's amazing how fast seventeen years go

You get to know your wife again and you're
More in love than you've ever been
With a lot of years of remember when's and still some down the road

'Cause next thing you know

And you take 'em to church, teach 'em to fish
And you, tell 'em stories every chance you get
About how fast this life down here can go

But soon as I get out here on the outskirts
I wish I was runnin' by your house first
Somethin' 'bout a summer in the south sure
Shines like gold down these old
Round bale, river valley back roads
Way back in the holler where the grass grows
God almighty, baby, we were that close
To ditchin' this town and settlin' down
Out here on the outskirts

If I'da had a lick of damn sense
I'd be on the greener side of that fence
Little starter house we've finally outgrown
Twelve-hundred feet we're 'bout to add on
Smilin' out there watchin' them
Big ol' yellow buckets 'bout to break ground
While you're shootin' all my baby names down

I'm over all these Saturday nights
I miss the stars in your eyes

We were gonna give up on the fast life
Have a couple babies, raise 'em up right
Take 'em to the river, get 'em baptized
Back in our day, if I'da just stayed
I wouldn't be livin' in this condo
Hangin' out with Hailey from Toronto

To ditchin' uptown, puttin' roots down

We've been burnin' both ends
Keepin' the lights on
So I've been thinkin' we need
A little time alone

So what you say we cancel our plans?
Tonight I'm only gonna be your man

Let's get some candles burning
And some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make

There ain't no way, baby
To get me out this house
When you look this good
What could I even think about? Oh, oh

Besides turn around and lockin' the door
Watching your red dress fall to the floor

Let's get some candles burning
And some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long
Writin' our love song

Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make

(Heads Carolina, tails California)

I was out with the boys, catchin' up in a neon light
Didn't know 'til we walked in it was karaoke night
She was in a circle of girls, chasin' a shot with a lime
She was laughin', they were darin' her to get on the mic
One of 'em walked up and turned in her name
Next thing I knew, man, she was up on the stage, singin'

""Heads Carolina, tails California""
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive hеr anywhere from herе to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at ""Heads Carolina""

Yeah, she knew every word by heart, didn't need no screen, no
I was raisin' my glass up for her, I saw her smilin' at me, yeah
She had me down in the front by the end of verse two
Like there wasn't no one else in the room, we were singin'

I still see that girl every time I hear that song

Took me to Knoxville last Saturday
And I wore the hat on his dash to the game

Fell for him under those Neyland lights

It was right after senior year
Just before the summer disappeared
We went a-ridin' them old farm ruts
Hangin' out on the gate of his truck
We threw a blanket 'neath the sunset
Bein' brave as eighteen gets
We gave each other more than our hearts
With the help of a mason jar

Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was minе
Too young to know what love was
But we werе learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
Watermelon moonshine

I don't remember where we got it from
I just remember feelin' all grown up
Takin' pulls like it ain't no thing
Never told him it was my first drink
But I told him that he was the one
You're so sure when you're that young
You think you got it all figured out
And now I laugh when I think about

Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was mine
Too young to know what love was
But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
Watermelon moonshine

I thought that high would last forever
But that ain't what it does
Maybe we were drunk in love
Or maybe we were just

Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was mine
Too young to know what love was
But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time

I love a first cast when the water's glass and the line starts to run
Or that first sip of a cold beer when the working week's done
I love the twilight in the morning 'fore the day wakes up
With the windows down on the first ride in a paid-up truck
And I love a slow down in a beach town with an ocean view
And I love a first fall Saturday trip down to Baton Rouge
And I love a six-string with the stars out and the campfire glow
But girl, that don't even come close

To the way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearin'
That look in your eye, girl, when you catch me starin'
And I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it
I can't imagine me livin' without this
Back forty view on our piece of ground
Watching you watch the sun going down
That's what my world spins around

Well, I finally get it now, when they say you know, you know
And yeah, girl, you had me from that first hello
And the only thing better is Heaven above
But until I get there, I'll never get enough of

The way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearin'
That look in your eye, girl, when you catch me starin', and
I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it
I can't imagine me livin' without this

Heard you moved out to South Carolina

Packed your bags in that old 4Runner
That I bought you when things were good
I'm glad to see the stop sign didn't hit ya
Bring you back to your senses
Oh, it waved you gone, goodbye
Yeah, it waved you gone, goodbye

I heard you found yourself a brand-new man
Put a rock on your finger and he vowed you a second chance
Built a house right by the coast
That ocean view is beautiful, but baby, I just want you to know
He don't know you like I did
Money talks, but I ain't buyin'

And I stopped to ask her how she's been
Said she's missin' ya and tried to go convincin' ya
Not to settle down with him

You had a bed of roses, but girl, you couldn't walk that line

Morgan Wallen (ترجمه‌ی فارسی) Lyrics
2 AM at a Broadway bar
ساعت 2 بامداد تو یه بار تو خیابون برادوی
She's puttin' her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
شماره اش رو میزنه تو گوشیم (دخترای تنهای اهل برادوی)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don't mean
دوتا بطری آبجو بادلایت تا آخر خورده شده،  و چیزایی میگه که منظوری نداره
And you know
و میدونی که

I met her down at Aldean's
تو رستوان بار ""اَلدنز نشویل"" دیدمش
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
گفت که حدود یک مایل دورتر من رو در حال قدم زدن دید
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
پسر خاله ام ""بین"" فقط میخواست تلفنش رو ازش بگیره (تا ازم فیلم نگیره) و همین لبخندش رو از بین بر
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
گفت زیادی مست و دیوونه ام، نحوه رقصیدنم رو دوست نداره
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
گفتم: مجبور نیستی بهم ملحق بشی. گفت شانسشو امتحان میکنه
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
از وقتی که نقشه ام شکست خورد یه جورایی دیوونه بودم
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
یه جورایی گم شدم، و این چیزی بود که فهمیدم
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around
دخترای مثل تو فقط میخوان من رو دور بزنن، دور بزنن، دور بزنن

Oh, there's two things that you'rе gonna find out
اوه، دوتا چیز هست که قراره بفهمی
They don't love you and they only lovе you right now
اونا عاشقت نیستن و فقط همین الان دوستت دارن
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
اگه زرنگ بودم، میموندم خونه
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
و دخترای اهل برادوی رو تنها میذاشتم (تنهاشون میذاشتم، تنهاشون میذاشتم)
Them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
دخترای تنهای اهل برادوی (تنهاشون میذاشتم، تنهاشون میذاشتم)
Leave them Broadway girls alone
دخترای اهل برادوی رو تنها میذاشتم

They town just told me, ""Don't trust 'em""
اهالی شهرشون بهم گفتن: بهشون (به دخترای برادوی) اعتماد نکن
Broadway girls a trap
دختر اهل برادوی یه تله است
They on me, they tryna finesse me
مهمون منن، سعی میکنن زرنگی کنن
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
منو با ""مرگان"" دیدن و میدونن رپ میکنم
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
اسب من (ماشینم) پورشه، بهم توجه میکنن
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
پریدم رو یه اسب، اونم نشست پشتم
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
رفتم بار تا واسش یه نوشیدنی بگیرم
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
بهم گفت رپ دوست نداره، آهنگ های ""پینک"" رو گوش میده
I can't run out of money
نمیتونم بی پول بشم (معنی دوم: نمیتونم بدون پول ادامه بدم)
The trenches love me forever
محله های فقیرو خلافکار همیشه دوستم دارن
They treat me like Ed in London
مثل ""اد شیرن"" تو لندن باهام رفتار میکنن
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
بردمش استخر، بعدش رایگان یه آبجو گرفتم
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
بوت های ""تیکوواس""، گیتار، سیگار، بار مشروب
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars
مثل ماشین ها سوار گاو نر میشه، معمولا با آدم معروفا خوب نیس

Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out
حالا، دوتا چیز هست که قراره بفهمی
They don't love you and they only love you right now
اونا عاشقت نیستن و فقط همین الان دوستت دارن

Oh, think I oughta settle down
اوه، فکر کنم باید به اینن وضع عادت کنم
And find me somethin' I can take back to my hometown, oh
و یه چیزی پیدا کنم تا بتونم باهاش برگردم به شهر خودم، اوه
But I told 'em that I'm savage
ولی بهشون گفتم که من رام نمیشم
They just tryna tell me there's
اونا فقط میخواستن بهم بگن:

If you could see that I'm the onе who understands you

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinking to myself
""Hey, isn't this easy?""
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town

You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doin' with a girl like that?

I won't tell the hell that he put me through

Few days before he turned 80
He was sitting out back in a rocker

And in between sips of coffee

Said ""If you want my two cents on making a dollar count

Buy dirt

Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church

And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick

Before you get caught on that ladder
Let me tell you what it's all about
Find you a few things that matter
That you can put a fence around
And then he laid it out

We used to be the life of the party
Body to body, dance the night away
Shoot tequila straight
Obsessed with each other
And down for another round until last call
Wasn't alcohol

Keeping us up 'til the sun came around
Thought we'd stay drunk forever but now

You're the reason there's no whiskey anywhere inside this house
You're the reason all my friends know I don't go downtown
You're the reason I hate champagne, never used to turn it down
You're thе only thing I want when one drop hits my mouth
Baby, you're thе reason I quit drinking

We used to be dizzy all morning
Hungover, pouring cups of coffee black
Kiss and crawl right back
Under the covers and down for another
Hour in that bed, now I'm here instead

Waking up sober, it feels kinda nice
Except that I can't sleep at night

You're the reason there's no whiskey anywhere inside this house
You're the reason all my friends know I don't go downtown
You're the reason I hate champagne, never used to turn it down
You're the only thing I want when one drop hits my mouth
Baby, you're the reason I quit drinking

I quit thinking (I quit thinking), staring at the ceiling (Oh, oh)
And all my cabernet is down the kitchen sink and (It's down the kitchen sink, yeah)
I quit mixing (I quit mixing), all my drinks and feelings
It's not fixing that you're gone

I didn't know if we were over or just on the rocks
Was me thinking I can save us just a mirage?
I was burning up the highway, it kept getting longer
With every turn of these tires, she just kept getting goner

And the sky was showing no signs of rain
Ain’t nothing delaying that plane

I'm racing through the desert
Thinking I can catch her
But losing ground in this Chevrolet
And that 747 somewhere between here and heaven
And heaven knows I let her slip away
I showеd up and she's gone
Guess I got to Tucson too latе

I wonder if she sat there stirring vodka with a straw
Was she counting down the seconds or maybe having second thoughts?
And was moving on made up in her mind?
Would she have changed it if she knew that I

Was racing through the desert
Thinking I can catch her
But losing ground in this Chevrolet?
And that 747 somewhere between here and heaven
And heaven knows I let her slip away
I showed up and she’s gone
Guess I got to Tucson too late, oh

Now she's on some silver wings flying
And me I'm on the bad side of good timing, yeah

I'm racing through the desert
Thinking I can catch her
But losing ground in this Chevrolet (Chevrolet)
That 747 somewhere between here and heaven
And heaven knows I let her slip away (Slip away)
I showed up and she's gone
Guess I waited too long
Like a sad country song
Damn, I got to Tucson too late

(Tucson too late)
Too late
Oh, I got to Tucson too late"

Man, this bar must've got a bad barrel
'Cause this whiskey ain't working on me
Kinda makes a guy wonder what they're doing
Down the road in Tennessee

I've been taking this No. 7 five deep
Trying to drown her memory

But it ain't doin' jack
To forget the door, slamming out the drive
Tearing up the gravel, saying she ain't coming back
Left me on the porch, thinking I should be drinking
She don't love me anymore
Running up a tab with a bottle dressed in black
Pour me another glass
'Cause it ain't doin' jack
No, it ain't doin' jack

Usually, a couple down is a quick fix
But her eyes and goodbye are still hanging on
Bartender, can you go and get me another round?
One that ain't watered down

But it ain't doin' jack
To forget the door, slamming out the drive
Tearing up the gravel, saying she ain't coming back
Left me on the porch, thinking I should be drinking
She don't love me anymore
Running up a tab with a bottle dressed in black
Pour me another glass
'Cause it ain't doin' jack
No, it ain't doin' jack

Tip 'em back, 'cause it ain't doing jack
So hit me with another one
Tip 'em back, 'cause it ain't doing jack
So hit me with another one

But it ain't doin' jack
To forget the door, slamming out the drive
Tearing up the gravel, saying she ain't coming back

Back then, right now

Back when that blacktop was just a gravel road
Back when that Walmart was just a fishin' hole
Back when my ol' guitar had some brand-new strings
Yes, it did
Back when a work truck was just a stick shift
Back when you took a pic and didn't have to post it
Back when a Baptist church was where we learned to sing
Yeah, we did

I could use some back then, right now
'98 Chevy with the tailgate down
FM only with the gold up loud
Burnin' up the night, innocent and wild
I could use a little more wide-open
Back when all I wanted was the hand I was holdin'
Livin' in the moment with the good-time crowd
Makin' life count
Damn, I could use a little more
Back then, right now
Back then, right now

Back when a, ""How ya been?"" came through a phone call
Back when a pastime was watchin' baseball
Yeah, back when politics, it wasn't table talk
Back when you had a fight, you could just walk it off

I could use some back then right now
'98 Chevy with the tailgate down
FM only with the gold up loud
Burnin' up the night, innocent and wild
I could use a little more wide-open
Back when all I wanted was the hand I was holdin'
Livin' in the moment with the good-time crowd

Damn, I could use a little more

Back then, it was simple, it was slow
We didn't worry 'bout what we didn't know

I could use some back then, right now

Burnin' up the night, innocent and wild
I could use a little more wide-open

In the middle of the night
I hear a cornfield coyote cry
Up at the moon no matter what
Sky I'm layin' under
In the eye of a hurricane
When I got one foot in the grave
I'll dig my boots into the dirt
And face the rollin' thunder

I'm five generations of blazin' a trail
Through barbed-wire and valleys and overgrown dells
I'm barefoot and bareback and born tough as nails
Woah, oh, oh
I'm four-fifths of reckless and one-fifth of Jack
I push like a daisy through old sidewalk cracks
Yeah, my kinda crazy's still runnin' its courses with
Wildflowers and wild horses

It's in the water, in my vеins
That bread of heaven falls likе rain
So I'm taken care of either way
Make somethin' out of how I'm made
Until I hitch a ride on glory's train

I'm five generations of blazin' a trail
Through barbed-wire and valleys and overgrown dells
I'm barefoot and bareback and born tough as nails
Woah, oh, oh
I'm four-fifths of reckless and one-fifth of Jack

And it felt so real that I couldn't let go
While you ran me around like a motherfuckin' rodeo

You burn a hole through my mind

Like I'm not here with all of this mess
And you drunk and out and you wildin' out
And you lit with all your friends
And I hate that shit, I wanna break that shit
I wanna do the same to your head
Usеd to love that parkin' lot
Now I wouldn't be caught dead on it

You startеd a goddamn wildfire
But somethin' about it ain't right
