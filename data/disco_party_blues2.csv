I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside, I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl

I've got so much honey, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl

Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh, yeah

I don't need no money, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches, baby, one man can claim
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl
(Talkin' 'bout my girl)

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day (Woah, woah)
With my girl
I've even got the month of May
With my girl
Talkin' 'bout, talkin 'bout, talkin 'bout my girl
Ooh, my girl
That's all I can talk about is my girl
Why don't you believe she's all my girl"

Ooh-ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears, I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life, you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else
Instead

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

People say believe half of what you see
Son, and none of what you hear
But I can't help being confused
If it's true please tell me, dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?
Don't you know

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
I heard it through the grapevine
Ooh, I'm just about to lose my mind

When I wake up in the mornin', love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And somethin' without warnin', love
Bears heavy on my mind

Then I look at you
And the world's all right with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seemed impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's all right with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be

A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)

And stand around
Cause I was too nervous
To really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor and thought
""Somebody could choose me""
No more standin' there beside the walls
I done got myself together, baby
And now I'm havin' a ball
As long as you're groovin'
There's always a chance
Somebody watchin'
Might wanna make romance
Move your body, ooo baby, and dance all night
To the groove and feel alright
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me spread out and let me in
Baby just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone
Move it up
Turn it 'round
Shake it down
Oooww!!

You can love me when you want to, baby
This is such a groovy party, baby
We're here face to face
Everybody's swingin'
This is such a groovy place
All the young ladies are so fine!
You're movin' your body easy with no doubts
I know what you thinkin', baby
You wanna turn me out
Think I'm gonna let you do it, babe

Take time if you're down on luck
It's so easy to walk out on love
Take your time if the going gets tough
It's so precious

So if you want it to get stronger
You'd better not let go
You gotta hold on longer
If you want your love to grow
Gotta stick together
Hand in glove
Hold tight, don't fight

You say your prayers though you don't care
You dance and shake the hurt

And the beat goes on
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong, on and on

Do you ever wonder
That to win, somebody's got to lose
I might as well get over (The blues)
Just like fishing in the ocean
There'll always be someone new

(Who'll love you better)
You did me wrong
But I've been through stormy weather

And the beat goes on
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on (You'd better believe it)
Still moving strong, on and on

Don't stop for nobody
This time, I'll keep my feet on solid ground
Now I understand myself (When I'm down)
Like the sweet sound of hip music
There'll always be something new

To keep the tables turning
Hate this simple song
But there'll never be an ending

And the beat goes on
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong, on and on

The beat goes on (The beat goes on)
The beat goes on
The beat goes on (The beat goes on)
The beat goes on
Guitar playing that fill to show the beat is real
The beat goes on

(Do you ever wonder) Well
That to win, somebody's got to lose
I might as well get over (The blues)
Just like fishing in the ocean
There'll always be someone new

(Who'll love you better)
Girl, you did me wrong
But I've been through stormy weather

And the beat goes on (Yeah, yeah)
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong, and I love it
And the beat goes on (Keep movin', keep movin' right on)
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on (Just like my love, baby)
Just like my love, my love, baby (On and on)

And the beat goes on
Don't stop the groovin'
Don't stop the groovin'

And the beat goes on (Woo)
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on (Got to make it last)
Still moving strong, and I love it (Better believe it, baby)

And the beat goes on (And the beat goes on and on and on)
Just like my love, everlasting (Everlasting, baby)
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong, and I love it
And the beat goes on (Just like my love, baby)
Just like my love, baby (Everlasting)
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong, and I love it

The beat goes on (The beat goes on)
The beat goes on
The beat goes on (The beat goes on)
The beat goes on
The beat goes on (The beat goes on)
The beat goes on

Are we really sure
That a love that lasted for so long
Still endures?
Do I, really care?
Hey hey
Let's talk about the distractions going on elsewhere

I, keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why? I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark
Oh, in the dark, woo

My mind drifts now and then
Looking down dark corridors and wonders what might have been
Something's up ahead
Hey, should I keep this same direction
Or go back instead?

I, I keep hearing footsteps baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why? I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark
Oh, in the dark, hoo

Honey, let's stop walking around
When there's love lost to be found
Oh, and you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense of going elsewhere?

Who feels, really sure?
Can that feeling guarantee your happiness shall endure?
Do we really care?
Hey hey
Let's look at what's been happening and try to be more aware

I, I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark, ay, in the dark
Why? I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark
Oh, in the dark, hoo

Hey hey, let's stop walking around
Well, when there's love lost, lost to be found
Oh honey, you Know I still care, I still care
What's the sense of going, going elsewhere?
Oh honey, let's stop walking around, and around, and around
When there's no love to be found

I know your eyes in the mornin' sun
I feel you touch me in the pourin' rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my saviour when I fall

And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

Oh, what a night
Late December, back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember, what a night

Oh, what a night
You know, I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I, I got a funny feeling
When she walked in the room
And my, as I recall
It ended much too soon

(Oh, what a night)
Hypnotizing, mesmerizin' me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

And I felt a rush
Like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around
And takin' my body under
(Oh, what a night)

Oh, I got a funny feeling
When she walked in the room
And my, as I recall
It ended much too soon

(Oh, what a night)
Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I felt a rush
Like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around
And takin' my body under

(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do do

Ooh

She sits alone waitin' for suggestions
He's so nervous, avoidin' all the questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently poundin'
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinkin'?

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so (Tell me so, baby)

He's actin' shy, lookin' for an answer
Come on, honey, let's spend the night together
Now, hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his high-rise apartment
At last, he can tell exactly what his heart meant

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, honey, tell me so
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar, let me know, ow

His heart's beating like a drum
'Cause, at last, he's got this girl home
Relax, baby, now, we are all alone, ow


They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside, it's cold, misty and it's raining
They got each other, neither one's complaining
He says, ""I'm sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee
Never mind, sugar, we can watch the early movie""

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know

I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

Now I heard a cryin' man is half a man
With no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you, I don't mind weepin'
If it'll keep you by my side

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walkin' away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
'Cause I want to keep you any way I can

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go


Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to come and plead to you, baby
If pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out of that door

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

Baby, baby, baby, (Ooh, sweet darlin')

Ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

She was born in New Orleans
New Orleans, Louisiana
Branded with the name Lisa Sawyer
Circa 1963

Grandmother was Indian, Indian
Her mother's name was Eartha, swift as the wind
Fierce as fire
Her father's name was Victor
Worked two jobs to provide for his flock

She was the youngest of seven, seven
She grew up on Louisa Street
Chaos around, but inside cozy
Small, but a mansion in her eyes
Eyes, eyes, mansion

Never had much money, money
But was filthy rich
With the wealth you couldn't get from a dark casino
Or a lottery ticket
They had love, love, love
Rich in love


She had the complexion of
The complexion of a sweet praline
Hair long as the sea, heart warm like the Louisiana sun
Voice like a symphony
Of the most beautiful instruments, ooh
Beautiful

At the age of sixteen, sixteen
She found Christ at an altar
All along He was calling her name
The Gospel spoken from an old wrinkly man
Man, man
Gospel

She was born in New Orleans
She was born in New Orleans
She was born in New Orleans

Some stranger who don't understand my head
Wish it was you lying here instead

Drowning in a sea of pretty faces
Being quite the man about the town
Packing up and going different places
But I show miss having you around

I listen to the noises down the hall
Think I'll move out of here in the fall
I ain't exactly having me a ball

In broken nights and wasted days
I really don't know what our love is doing to you
I know you think that I don't care
That I see your face everywhere
Ooh, another funny honeymoon
I'll sit alone in my room at night
Nothing else to do
Lost my mind and my appetite
I'm as damaged as you
Sweet success don't do me no good
Such a long way to go
Dirty habits destroy my blood
And it's beginning to show
I only know what a heartache pays
In broken nights and wasted days
I really don't know what our love is doing to you
I know you think that I don't care
That I see your face everywhere
Ooh, another funny honeymoon
Ah, well it's gone and we'll let it go
Thеre's no new yestеrday
I know we didn't have very much to show
But it's gone anyway

I only know what a heartache pays
In broken nights and wasted days
I really don't know what our love is doing to you
I know you think that I don't care
That I see your face everywhere
Ooh, another funny honeymoon
I only know what a heartache pays
In broken nights and wasted days
I really don't know what our love is doing to you
I know you think that I don't care
That I see your face everywhere
Ooh, another funny honeymoon
I know you think that I don't care
That I see your face everywhere

To help you to remember
Baby, please forget me not
I want you to remember
Sending you forget me nots
To help you to remember
Baby, please forget me not
I want you to remember

Those were the times we had
Sharing a joy that we thought would last
Memories of love and affection
Never really was just like a dream
Was it the simple things
That made me so crazy about you
Was it your charm or your passion
It's not hard to believe
I love you and I need you so I'm

Sending you forget me nots
To help you to remember
Baby, please forget me not
I want you to remember
Sending you forget me nots
To help you to remember
Baby, please forget me not
I want you to remember

Did we give up too soon?
Maybe we needed just a little room
Wondering how it all happened
Maybe we just need a little time
Though we did end as friends
Given the chance, we could love again
She'll always love you forever
It's not hard to believe
I want you and I need you so I'm

Sending you forget me nots
To help you to remember
Baby, please forget me not
I want you to remember
Sending you forget me nots (Forget me nots)
To help you to remember
Baby, please forget me not (Forget me not)
I want you to remember


Sending you forget me nots
Baby, please forget me not
Good times we had (Sending you forget me nots)
They weren't so bad
What a life we shared (Baby, please forget me not)
Pretty baby, I still care

Sending you forget me nots
To help you to remember
Baby, please forget me not
I want you to remember
Sending you forget me nots
To help you to remember (Help you to remember)"

Come here, sister
Papa's in the swing
He ain't too hip
About that new breed thing

He ain't no drag
Papa's got a brand new bag
Come here, mama
And dig this crazy scene
He's not too fancy
But his line is pretty clean
He ain't no drag
Papa's got a brand new bag
He's doing The Jerk
He's doing The Fly
Don't play him cheap
'Cause you know he ain't shy
He's doing The Monkey, The Mashed Potatoes
Jump back Jack, see you later, alligator
Come here, sister

He ain't too hip now
But I can dig the new breed thing
He ain't no drag

Well, Papa, you're doing The Jerk

You're doing The Twist, just like this

Ain't no woman like the one I've got
Ain't no woman like the one I've got
Ain't no woman like the one I've got

Every day the sun comes up around her
She can make the birds sing harmony
Every drop of rain is glad it found her
Heaven must have made her just for me
When she smiles, so warm and tender
A sight for sore eyes to see, hoo

Ain't no woman like the one I've got
Oh no, they don't come better
To make her happy doesn't take a lot
She don't ask for things, no diamond rings
Sewed together, like a hand in glove
Like pages in a letter
Ain't no woman like the one I love

She can build me up when it's down I'm goin' (I'm goin')
Put a little music in my day
Wouldn't be surprised if my love keeps growin' (It keeps growin')
Bigger every minute that she stays away
I would kiss the ground she walks on
'Cause it's my word, my word she'll obey now, woo-hoo

Ain't no woman like the one I've got
Well, I kiss the ground she walks on
To make her happy doesn't take a lot
She's a real good friend right to the end
Sewed together like a hand in glove
I'm a lonely man when she's gone
People, ain't no woman like the one I love

Ooh, what a good, good thing I've got
She means, she means a lot

Ain't no woman like the I've got
Oh no, they don't come better
To make her happy doesn't take a lot
She don't ask for things, no diamond rings
Sewed together, like a hand in glove
Like pages in a letter
Ain't no woman like the one I love, people

Ain't no woman like the one I've got
Well, I kiss the ground she walks on
To make her happy doesn't take a lot

I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding
Opened the door up and to my surprise, there, you were standing
Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar?
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
And I just don't wanna stop

Oh, girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day

But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you

Here in your arms, I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now, I think I would die
Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time

More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman

Oh, now there are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking 'bout those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again

This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love, I know I would die
Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time

Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

I've heard people say that
Too much of anything is not good for you, baby (Oh, oh)
But I don't know about that
As many times as we've loved and
We've shared love and made love, it's (Well, well)
It doesn't seem to me like it's enough (Ah, yeah yeah)
It's just not enough of it
Uh, it's just not enough
Oh, oh, babe
Oh, babe

My darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why, can't get enough of your love, babe

Oh, some things I can't get used to, no matter how I try
It's like the more you give, the more I want and, baby, that's no lie
Oh no, babe, tell me, what can I say? What am I gonna do?
How should I feel when everything is you?
What kind of love is this that you're givin' me?
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?

Girl, all I know
Is every time you're here, I feel the change, huh
Somethin' moves, I scream your name
Look what you got me doin'

Darling, I, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh, no, babe

Girl, if I could only make you see and make you understand
Girl, your love for me is all I need and more than I can stand
Oh, well, babe
How can I explain all the things I feel?
You've given me so much, girl, you're so unreal still
I keep loving you more and more each time
Girl, what am I gonna do? Because you're blowin' my mind

I get the same old feelin'
Every time you're here, I feel the change
Somethin' moves, I scream your name
Look what you got me doin'

Darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh no, babe

Baby, it didn't take all of my life to find you
But you can believe it's gonna take the rest of my life to keep you
Oh, oh, babe
Ah

My darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why, can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh, my darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh, babe, girl, I don't know, I don't know why, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh, darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe"

I've been really trying, baby
Trying to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel like I feel, baby
Then come on, oh, come on, ooh

Let's get it on, ow, baby
Let's get it on, let's love, baby
Let's get it on, sugar
Let's get it on, woo

We're all sensitive people with so much to give
Understand me, sugar
Since we got to be here, let's live, I love you
There's nothing wrong with me loving you, baby, no, no
And giving yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true, oh, baby, ooh

Now don't you know how sweet and wonderful life can be? Ooh, ooh
I'm asking you, baby, to get it on with me, ooh, ooh, ooh
I ain't gonna worry, I ain't gonna push, I won't push you, baby
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, baby
Stop beating 'round the bush, hey

Let's get it on, ooh, ooh, let's get it on
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Come on, baby, hey, let your love come out

Oh, do right, baby

If you want to love me, just let yourself go
Oh baby, let's get it on right now"

Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Oh baby, now let's get down tonight
Ooh

Baby I'm hot just like an oven (Heal me, my darling)
I need some lovin' (Heal me, my darling)
And baby, I can't hold it much longer (Heal me, my darling)
It's getting stronger and stronger (Heal me, my darling)

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing, baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

Whenever blue teardrops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up, baby, and
Honey, I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Oh, I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing

(Get up, get up, get up, get up)
Let's make love tonight
(Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
'Cause you do it right

Baby, I got sick this morning (Heal me, my darling)
A sea was storming inside of me (Heal me, my darling)
Baby, I think I'm capsizing (Heal me, my darling)
The waves are rising and rising (Heal me, my darling)

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
Sexual healing, baby, it's good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

And it's good for me, and it's so good to me
My baby, ohhh
Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind, soon we'll be making it, honey
Oh, we're feeling fine
You're my medicine, open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great
I can't wait for you to operate

(Heal me, my darling)
I can't wait for you to operate

When I get this feeling (Heal me, my darling)
I need sexual healing
Oh, when I get this feeling (Heal me, my darling)
I need sexual healing
I gotta have sexual healing, darling (Heal me, my darling)
'Cause I'm all alone
I need sexual healing, darling (Heal me, my darling)
'Til you come back home
Please don't procrastinate (Heal me, my darling)
It's not good to masturbate"

My friends wonder why I call you all the time
What can I say?
I don't feel the need to give such secrets away
You think maybe I need help
Though I know I'm right, alright
I'm just better off not listening to friends' advice

When they insist on knowing my bliss
I tell them this
When they wanna know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I tell them why

Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

I go crazy wonderin' what there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time 'cause it means more to me
Sometimes I forget what I'm doing
I don't forget what I want, what I want
Regret what I've done, regret you? I couldn't go on

But if you insist on knowing my bliss
I'll tell you this
If you want to know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I'll tell you why

Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light


I really miss you, babe

Ahhh
(Because your kiss), Your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss), Your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Oh, babe, because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Oh-ooh, because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist"

Mamma been laid off
Pappa been laid off
My brother's been laid off
For more than two years now
Ooh, can't get a job
Billy can't get a job
They gotta listen to the blues

Help them to strive
Help them to move on
Help them to have some future
Help them to live long
Help them to live life
Help them to smile
Don't let them stay home
And listen to the blues

Pappa been laid off
Mamma been laid off
Billy can't get a job
For too long, too long
Don't let them lose
We gotta give them a chance
It's gonna come back on everyone
If you don't make them dance
Don't let them stay home
And listen to the blues

There's nothing sacred
Breathing hatred
We have to face it
No one can take it
And feel no pain

Mamma been laid off
Pappa been laid off
My brother's been laid off
For more than two years now
Ooh, can't get a job
Billy can't get a job
Ooh, they gotta listen to the blues

Help them to strive
Help them to move on
Help them to have some future
Help them to live long
Help them to live life
Help them to smile
Don't let them stay home
And listen to the blues

One day we're gonna wake up
And the ghetto's all around
All over, my friend
Have you ever seen a man break down?
Do you know how, how that feels?
To walk the streets
With your head held high
Oh Lord, have mercy
Did you ever see a man break down?

There's nothing sacred
Breathing hatred
We have to face it
No one can take it
And feel no pain

Ooh, did you ever see a man break down?"
