It's 7 in the morning y'all
She's still in there

Whiskey and chicken wings
People dancin' and drinkin'
And no one wants to leave

I found love on a lonely highway (2x)

She said: Can we talk about it? It looks like you're hurting
I think I've been in your shoes, tell me what you wanna do

I said: Woman, you're crazy, you can't help me
I'm looking for a lover who won't ever hurt me
She said: Why do you think I pulled you over
I wanna give you my love

Oh yes I did
I said: Maybe this is my chance to find new romance
I shouldn't act so crazy, and giving up on love

My my my my my my my, oh!

Now when she stepped out of the car...
When she stepped out of the car, y'all
I threw my head down
I believe I said something like (...)
I wonder can I change...
I wonder can I turn back the sands of time
You see y'all, when she stepped out of the car...
When she stepped out of the car
She was looking so good, so good
I said: Lord have mercy on me
Y'all know the rest...
Y'all know the rest of the story now
She put her arms around me, y'all
And we've been together ever since
I guess I found love..."

Lost
Judge everyone I see
Cause I'm judgemental
It gives me no ease
Being so so cruel
I'm running all night to escape that grasp
I'm hiding in this ugly facial mask
I want to be real where this phase is dead
I want to be real where this phase is dead
I don't know who's who and what is what
I'm tired of ghosting myself cause nothing feels right now

I don't

Turn it up

Big wheels keep on turnin'
Carry me home to see my kin

Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around, anyhow

Does your conscience bother you?

They pick me up when I'm feelin' blue

How did we come to this?
Two months ago it was bliss
We were planning a life
Oh, so easy and nice
Two months ago, your love felt so right

Two months ago, I still remember when
Said you craved something more with my friend
And I died and you let me
But you didn't let me go

And I'm going insane
As you twist thoughts in my brain
Wrap me into this game
I never wanted to play
But you hold me and sway
Like we fell yesterday
Gentle smile make me think it's okay

So I'll keep your fire warm
Just to hold you for a little whilе longer
Pretend just for show
So-callеd ""love"" overflows
How you turn me to ashes
But in circles you go
To burn bright with another
Then come back to me
Say we just need to try harder
Then convince me I'm the one who should leave
Baby, how could this be?
I'll keep lighting this fire
So you can take it away from me

You were sunshine
Now you're pouring rain
You felt so close
Now you're, oh, so far away
Now, it's cold in December
You bloom with her in May
God, you're beautiful to me
But she's holding your face

You were kindness
'Til you turned so cruel
You were patience
'Til you risked that we lose
No more sunsets on rooftops
Only hear your own views
Wasting words all about how you'll stay
Yet, you leave me to

Grieve everyday
Let you have it your way
Watch you bullshit your say
Never face your mistakes
As you call me unfair
All 'cause I needed you there
Tell me, darling
How does it compare?

When I keep your fire warm
Just to hold you for a little while longer
Call this pain ""compromise""
Hold more space for your pride
I held you for three years
You betrayed me for life
To burn bright with another
Yet don't set me free
Say, ""I swear I'll do better""
Empty promises you just couldn't keep
How could you not see?
That I keep lighting this fire
So you can take it away from me

You can leave if you want to (But I don't want to)
You can leave if I hurt you (I'll hurt with you if I have to)
We can try again if you want to (I'll try harder with you)
Please don't leave, I'll be better for you
I'll be better for you

Were you ready for this?
Two months ago I was perfect
Suddenly, I'm too much for you
How'd it turn out so wrong
When I trusted you to be ready for this?
But you weren't ready for this

Stretched yourself out too thin
And made myself believe it was me
Who wasn't ready
Now, it's not simple
Not free
Now, you dance to our song with a new pair of feet
I can't stay here forever
But oh, how I tried (You make my heart ache)
Oh, because you were mine

How did you sleep at night, baby
While you watched me burn
And all the hearts that you've hurt
Not just me, not just her
And as we turned cold
How were you still unsure
If goodbye was something you truly deserved?

So go on, dare to do it again
Go and fuck your lover's friend
Then try the least to make amends
See just how they like it then
See just how well it ends then
'Cause' you're simply the best, I bet
Bet you tell yourself that
Just to feel my ghost again

But she better tell you like it is
Not keep you warm like I did
Not think she deserved it like I did
And don't twist her words
When she's crying and says
How did we come to this?"

Girl, do you like it like that?
Do you want me to lay up in it from the back?
Girl, I like gettin' it and hittin' it from the back
I got rose petals on the floor
No need to knock, just come on in the door
Whipped cream and strawberries
All for ordinary you and me
We don't need no music
Cut off the TV, 'cuz it will be just you and me
Do you want me to get it from the back?
Girl, do you like it like that?
Do you want me to lay up in it from the back?
Girl, I like gettin' it and hittin' it from the back

Baby, when I get through with you
I'll make you give me the keys to the car
The keys to the house, your food stamp card
A gold grill in my mouth
A brand-new Cordadis and a brand-new suit
I had to match my brand-new boots
A house on the hill, a boat on the lake
Breakfast in the morning and a big, juicy steak
And baby, please don't forget your MasterCard
'Cause when I get done with you, girl, you will treat me like a movie star
Now won't you try me from the back?
Girl, do you like it like that?
Do you want me to lay up in it from the back?
Girl, I like gettin' it and hittin' it from the back"

I saw when you stepped into the club
The way you walk, the way your body moves
I was out there dancing on the floor
I was outta step, cause I was watching you
You're one fine sexy looking man, standing over there with that Hennessy in your hand
I'm looking at you, you looking at me
I'm thinking about the possibilities

Hey Mr. Sexy Man, what yo name is? What yo name is? (x2)

I had to come and ask you for a dance
You know this tiger had to take a chance
I just love the smell of your cologne
Man you got me hot, you really turn me on
Round here dancing on the floor, arms around my waist, baby I want some more
I'm staring at you, you staring at me
I'm thinking about the possibilities
 (x2)

I like the way feel baby, when you up on me
Got my hormones jumping, I feel your energy
I like your freaky dancing, you're really throwing down
You make me feel so good baby, let me turn around

 (x2)

Hey baby! Wanna know yo name (What yo name is? What yo name is?)

Hey, where did we go?
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughin' and a-runnin', hey, hey
Skippin' and a jumpin'
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a thumpin'

And you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall

With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-tee-da?
Just like that
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-tee-da
La-tee-da

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium

With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-tee-da? (Lyin' on the green grass)

Wanna go buy me a fresh pair of gators
With some of this money that I made

Singing about the whiskey
I think I’ll go by the store
To get me a bottle so I can be ready
To get my groove on the dance floor

Can you play “Motel Lover”
So I can ask this lady to please take me
I’ve been at work all week and I deserve
To come out and have a good time

Tonight I’m gonna to spend every dime

Now, this song is going out to all of you players
Wannabe players
Wannabe pimps
Mack daddys
Or whatever you call yourself
Well, you better get your game face on
'Cause this old lady told me one time
She say, ""Son, you men think you know what women want, but you don't""
And then she went on to tell me a story
And it goes something like this

All you wannabe lovers
There's something you need to know
Now this old lady told me a story a long time ago
She said, ""Theodis, men think they know what women want
But the truth about the whole thing is, boy, they really don't""
She said, ""I had a man who thought he was the world's greatest lover
But when you add his time up, he was just a five-minute brother""
He used to lick it, mm, he used to stroke it
You know, one night, we was makin' love, he said
That thang is so damn good, I wanna put it in my pipe and smoke it

She said, ""Theodis, you need to know
That you can lick it and you can stroke it
Now you can kiss it and you can eat it
But you ain't did a dog-gone thing until you stand up in it
Mm, got to stand up in it

Now this wannabe brother who thought he was the world's greatest lover
Stopped by my house the other day and caught me with my part-time lover
He said, ""Baby, ooh, baby, why you messin' around on me?
I make sure your rent's paid, I make sure your cable's on
Now, just the other day, I bought you a cell phone
Baby, ooh, baby, why you do me this way?""
She said, ""Theodis, men think they know what women want
But the truth about the whole thing is, boy, they really don't""

Now you can lick it, and you can stroke it
But you ain't did a dog-gone thing until you stand up in it
Now you can eat it, and you can lick it
But you ain't did a dog-gone thing until you stand up in it
Oh, you got to stand up in it, boy
Ooh, you got to stand up in it, yes, you do

Yeah, she said
""Now, Theodis, play that guitar for me like you're standing up in it""
I said, ""Alright,"" I went
She said, ""No, no, no, no, go'n, go'n
Play it like you're sta— you know, stand up in it
What? What? What? What? Stand on up on it""
I say, I said, ""Okay then, alright then,"" I, I said
Oh yeah, Theodis

She said, ""Theodis, men think they know what women want
But the truth about the whole thing is, son, they really don't""
She said
You can lick it, mm, you can stroke it
But you ain't did a dog-gone thing until you stand up in it, ooh
Now you can eat it, boy, and you can lick it, hey
But you ain't did a dog-gone thing until you stand up in it
Ooh, boy, you better stand up in it

Yeah, oh, oh
You got to stand on up in it, you know
Somebody said, you know, a woman got to have
Ooh, don't you know? She got to feel it, boy, every time
That what old Bobby Womack said, fellas, I'ma tell you somethin' now, he was right too
And
And the moral of this story is, is that
You can eat it, stroke it, lick it
Do anything you wanna do with it
But you ain't did nothing until you stand up in it

And I’m runnin’ out the back

You see, I wasn’t raised like that

Well, these women are jealous (Jealous)

Talking softly on the telephone

Playing that cheating game only leads to hurt and pain
And cause each other unhappy days

You've been faking, you've been faking
I've been going along with it hoping you can still make it
Even though it might hurt me, I just can't be a fool
I'd rather step on my heart and break it than to be used

I say lord why am I alone

There any ladies out there lonely
Is there someone for me

And I promise I promise I promise
Ill be a real real good man
Ill do all the things to show
How a good man understands
Cause right now I'm lonely lonely
And I'm feeling blue
And if you feel the same way
Maybe the woman can be you

Lonely yes I am
I need a good woman to live my life wit
Some to hold me whoa
Chorus x2
I need somebody to hold
Somebody to kiss
Somebody to make love to"

So many people, you had to stand in line
One night only in Soul Heaven
I didn't wanna wake up
I was having such a good time
All of The Bar-Kays were tuning up on stage
Jimi had his guitar, gettin' ready to play
Sam was singing ""A Change Gonna Come""
Otis was there, sittin' at the dock of the bay
There was a party in Soul Heaven
Superstars from the past
Standing room only, so you better hurry
Buy your ticket cause they're going fast
'Trane & Miles took a mean solo
Jr. Walker had 'em dancing in the aisles (Shoot 'em 'fore they run, now)
They stood up when Jackie sang ""Lonley Teardrops""
When Sammy (Davis, Jr.) danced, the crowd went wild (Mr. Bojangles)
I think I saw Ella standing with Mahalia
Backstage with Elvis with his blue suede shoes
It started raining, everybody just stayed there
To hear Z.Z. sing the ""Down Home Blues""
Well there's a party in Soul Heaven
Superstars from the past
Standing room only, so you better hurry
Buy your ticket cause they're going fast

There's a party in Soul Heaven
Superstars from the past
The great Al Jackson was a holding down the beat
When Marvin sang ""Let's Get It On"", they jumped to
Their feet
Everyone started screaming and gave a standing ovation
When the curtain came up with the mighty Temptations
King Curtis blew the ""Soul Serenade""
Thought I saw Lady Day sittin' in the shade
I got two lovers and I ain't ashamed
Lord I love the way sweet Mary sings
It was getting kinda late, it was time to go
2Pac and Biggie, they closed the show
(Boo!)
I didn't wanna wake up, I was having such a good time
I didn't wanna wake up, I was having such a good time
Pearl Bailey, she was there
Duke and Count, they were there
Woah Hathaway, I saw him there
Dizzie and Satchmo, I saw 'em there
It was a party in Soul Heaven
You shoulda been there
I know, you shoulda been there
Everyone was having such a good time
Soul Heaven
Soul Heaven"

Oh, men! I almost lost her;
I am glad she gave another chance
My friends - I got something I want to say and
I want everybody to listen to me good
You know that everybody who knows me
Knows that I have a good wife;
She does not drink, party, gamble, or smoke;
That is, the kind of woman every man wants - it is not that right?
And me? Everybody knows I am not that good
Drinking, gambling, I mean - just messing around with other woman;
I do not even deserve her
Ooh, I am such a lucky man - yes, I am;
However, this morning when I came home - she gave me a choice;
She said me, or the road;
Let me tell you all what I have decided - if you do not mind
I hope you will understand it
I got to clean up what I messed up
Start my life over again
I am going to clean up (yes, I have);
What I messed up
Start my life over again
(Ooh, hear me you all)
I made up my mind; I am not cheating no more
If I do not stop - she might let me go
I got to clean up what I messed up (Ooh)
Start my life over again
(Ooh, hear me you all)
I am going to clean up, what I messed up
Start my life over again
(Ooh, hear me you all)
I made up my mind - I am not gambling no more
Losing all of our money, I just have to go
I got to clean up what I messed up (yes, I have)
Start my life over again
I am going to clean up what I messed up
Start my life over again
Everybody listen - I made up my mind
I am not laying any more - cause if I do
I will have to go
I got to clean up, what I messed up
Start my life over again
I am trying to tell you that
I am going to clean up, what I messed up
Start my life over again
Ooh, listen to me good
Spoken Words II
All you women out there
Who happened to be a single;
Nope, you did do nothing wrong - nothing at all
I just cannot see you no more
I got to make the change
You see - listen, I am tired of doing wrong - yes I am
I am going to do right from now on;
May be there is someone else out there
Who done wrong, and want to do right
Well, here is your chance - would it be you
Or would it be both of you?
Let me ask you something, can I?
Have you did somebody wrong? (Ooh, yes)!
Have lied on somebody? (Ooh, yes)!
Have you cheated on somebody? (Ooh, yes)!
Do you stay out all night (Ooh, yes)!
Gambling; partying all night long - huh? (Ooh, yes)!
Do you spend too much money on gambling, and (Ooh, yes)!
Cannot even pay your bills about food for the children to eat?
Do you - tell me? (Ooh, yes)!
Spoken Words III
Now, I believe that some of you out there
Got a good wife or a good husband at home;
Why do not you just say this to yourself?
I am going to clean up, what I messed up
Start my life over again
I am going to clean up (say it to yourself)
What I messed up (it is all you got to do)
Start my life over again
I have got to clean up - ooh
What I messed up (Ooh, yes)!
Start my life over again (Ooh, yes)! (2X)
No more party for Marvin (Ooh, yes)
I am going to clean up what I messed up
No more gambling
Start my life over again (Ooh, yes)
No more staying out all night long
I am going to clean up what I messed up
No more messing around with other people...
If I can do - you can do too; I know you can
All you got to do is - say to yourself
I am going to clean up what I messed up"

Well, I couldn't resist the urge to tell you the end of my story
For all those who wanted to know was there life after the pain

After the pain
You come and love me
And I welcome you
You're a glad sight to see
And after the rain
And all that I have been through
I still can't explain
How I can still love you like I do
But I do, yes, I do

Still love you like I do (After the pain)
Though you still do me like you do (After the pain)

After the pain
We sit and we talk awhile
And I fight with all my might
To hold back the tears from falling with a pleasant smile
And after the rain
I can't believe you got the nerve to still call me, baby
And I try to tell you, No, it ain't so
But I guess No' just ain't in me

'Cause boy, I still love you like I do (After the pain)
Though you still do me like you do (After the pain)

Yeah, I know you're laughin'
Those of you who heard 'Pain'
Yeah, you're right, I sure did
I said I'd never take him back again
Well, it's a woman's prerogative to change her mind isn't it?
But we do it all the time
Don't laugh, you probably done the same thing, too
It's just that you know me and I don't know you
You know one thing, time has taught me that
Havin' a piece of man is better than havin' no man at all
So I'ma just take what I got and work with it
You understand what I mean?
And don't you remember thinkin' back just a few years
When people used to try to help you stay together
They find out you're on the verge of breakin' up
They used to cook up a little food and throw a little party
And whisper things in your ear like

'Don't blame Mr. Charlie, Mr. Charlie is just a man
And he's doing the best he can'
I heard 'em say, 'Don't blame Mr. Charlie, Mr. Charlie is just a man
And he's doing the best he can'

That's why I still love you like I do (After the pain)
Though you still do me like you do (After the pain, the pain)

I know that you know it's true
After all I've been through
I should be through with love
But there's a God up above
That keeps sayin', 'Betty try
Don't give up, you know why
The sun is gonna shine
Cause you are mine, all mine'
You just keep doin' your best
And I will do the rest
'Cause I love you, love you, Betty, like I do

That's why I still love you like I do (After the pain, the pain)
Though you still do me like you do (After the pain, the pain)

My love is deeper than any ocean
And my love is higher than any mountain
It's, oh, it's full of emotion
My love is full of devotion
My love is in and out of season
And I love you with or without a reason
You see, God is gonna bless me for lovin' you
For all the times that you treated me wrong and I kept bein' true
You see, God's eyes they're not closed
He's not asleep
Said He's watchin' every move you make
Every secret you keep
Boy, you better be careful
Hoo hoo hoo hoo
Said if you treat me bad or make my sad
My Father in heaven is watching you
But I still love you like I do (After the pain)
And no-n-n-no-n-n-no-n-n-nobody's ever gonna love you like I do (After the pain)
Said no one's ever gonna love you like I do
No one's ever gonna love you like I do
No one's ever gonna love you like, like I do
I don't know why I do, but I do, yes, I do (After the pain)
Oh, there's a woman in me that keeps on lovin' you (After the pain, the pain)
I don't know why
Oh, I don't know why (I don't know why, baby) (After the pain, the pain)
I don't know why (I don't know why, baby), but I do (I do)
Said I do (I do, I do, I do)
Said I... (After the pain, the pain)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa) (After the pain, the pain)
I do, I don't know why, baby (After the pain, the pain)
But I love you so
Yes, I do (After the pain, the pain)
Baby, don't you know it's true, yes, I do
Baby (After the pain), no strain (The pain)
Still love you after the pain (The pain)
(After the pain)"

I was sitting at home
And my best friend came over
And he looked at me with tears in his eyes
I ain't even have to ask him what's wrong
He looked at me
He said I didn't go to work today
He say I followed my woman
To the travelling inn…. hotel
And it broke my heart ohw…
And I said man maybe
You just outta forget about her
And he said sir charles maybe you´ve never been in love
Or maybe you´ve never felt the things
That I feel for the little girl
But all I know I know I know
And I sat there watching the tears roll down his face
And he looked me in my eyes
And he said these words
I just can't let go
No…. no no…
Just can't let go
No… no no…

And then he said
I never missed one day… from work
Never deny
Her to least little things
I'm a father to the children
Sometimes I cook the food
Bring home my money
Let her do. what she wan.na do
He said I know
That I'm
A good man
Why do she do the things that she do
Why don't she understand
Still
I can't´ let go
No… no no
I just can't let go
No…no no no no no…
He said I love the pretty little girl
I can't let go
No. no no…
Just can´t let go
No. no no…
And then he said
I know everybody
Thinking it ain't cool
But everybody
Down the line
Somewhere
Been a fool
And then I stepped in and I said man
You've got a woman
With a heart that's cold
Just like ice
But everyone will be a fool ones
But never be a fool twice
But he said
Just can't let go
Just can't let go
No… no No
Just can't let go
No no no no no...
Just can't let go
No. no no…
He said I'd rather be fool
Cause I can't let go
Just can't let go
No… no no…
Just can't let go

You know I'd never thought I would be living my life without you
You know sometimes though, I think about the good times we had
We was suppose to be togehter forever
For better or for worse
Sickness and health, til death do us part
I can't believe you left me
What happened to for better or worse, we traded a vow, and now my heart is hurt, what happened to for better or worse, we traded a vow, and now my heart is hurt

First of all, I'd like to say good evening
And we're so pleased that
So many of you could come out and share
In all the love and all the happiness we have in store for you
We want you to have a real good time
'Cause that's just what we have in mind
Is that alright with you?
Now, this is a tune that I composed
And it's called ""Tonight is the night""
That you make me a woman
Now, I never intended recording this song
It was a personal poem
That is until the day that my producer
Happened to thumb through the pages of my notebook
He came across the words and he said
'We gotta do somethin' with these words
It's happening every day
And people wanna hear about it, Betty'
You see, it's the story of a young girl
Making love for the very first time
Now, when I finally got a melody
I took it home and I, I played it for my mother
Now, I gotta tell you a little bit about my mother
You see, I come from one of those pretty large families
And I'm the baby of the family
And you know you never grow up to your mother
I'll never forget the way she looked at me when I played it for her
She said, 'Uh, I like the music
You know, baby, the melody, it's really nice
But I know you're not gonna sing that song'
But we eased it right on by, yes, we did
And it became one of my biggest records, too
So I want you to do this for me if you will
Everybody think back to your very first time...
Now, I'll give you a little while longer
'Cause I know some of you
Have to think back a little bit further than others
Come on now, I want you to play catch-up
'Cause I don't want you waitin' 'til I get to the end of my song
Sayin', 'Oh, yeah, now I remember'
Now, whether it was good
Oh, you just smilin', it was good
Or on the other hand if it was not so good
Here's my story

Hmm...hmm...mmm...mmm...

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mmm
You said you'll be gentle with me
And I, I hope you will, mmm
I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
I'm tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still, no

I can hear your car door slammin'
I wanna play big girl and put on a sexy smile
But I know so little about what love is
I just can't help actin' like a child
You're knockin' on my door and you're ringin' my bell
Hope you're not impatient after waiting so very long
A whole year I put you off with my silly hang-ups
And we're both old enough to know right from wrong
Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mmm
You said you'll be gentle with me
And I, I hope you will, mmm
I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
Tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still

Mmm...hey, baby
Ho, ho, baby
Ho-oh...yeah...yeah, yeah, oh

But what if my mama should come home early
And catch us doin' what we're doin'
Not only will I never live it down
But my whole family relationship, it'll all be ruined
But we've gone a little bit too far now
Oh, to turn around
So let's just pray
That true love is what we've found
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Ho, I'll never forget tonight
No, no, I'll never forget tonight
That's when you make me feel real, mhm
You make me feel real, real good
Oh oh whoa oh oh whoa whoa
Yeah, and I wanna thank you, love
Said I've got to thank you, love
'Cause you make me feel good
And I love you, baby
I love you and I know it
And I ain't too proud to show it
'Cause I love you, baby
And I need you, baby
I want you, my love, my love
My, my, my baby
I'll never forget tonight
No, I'll never forget tonight
'Cause you make me feel good
And I love you, baby
You make me feel real good
And I love you, baby
'Cause you gave me
Uh, uh, pure love, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, pure love
Said I like that, baby
Uh, uh, pure love
Said I need that, sugar
Uh-uh-uh, pure love
There's nothin' phony about it
Uh-uh, pure love
Your love I can't do without it
Uh-uh-uh, pure love, ooh

I love him, I know it
I ain't too proud to show it
I love him, I know it
I ain't too proud to show it
I love him, I know it
I ain't too proud to show it
I love him, I know it
And I ain't too proud to show it
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Thank you
Thank you"

Once upon a time
We were a unit, we were a pair
But it's like it's all over now, darling
It's all out in the open
No more hiding, no more lies
And no more disappointments

Everything's out in the open, yeah
There is nothing left to hide, hmm

I thought we had a Garden of Eden
And we did before he came along
Before the fruits in the midst of his garden
Became the fruits that turned you on

Before God, we were joined together
Before a judge, we were taken apart
Before I would deliver the papers
You and him had made a brand new start

Everything's out in the open, yeah
There is nothing left to hide
All the vows have been broken
But I feel the same way inside

You see, just like Adam
You were my Eve
The only girl in the world for me
And just like that old story
Once again, you've been deceived

Before God, we were joined together
Before a judge, we were taken apart
Before I would deliver the papers
You and him had made a brand new start

Everything's out in the open, yeah
And there's nothing left to hide
All the vows have been broken
And I feel the same way inside
Everything's out in the open, open, open
Well, and there's nothing left to hide
But all the vows have been broken
And I feel the same way inside

Ooh, ooh ooh

My baby and are back together again
Lovin' is better than it's ever been
If it weren't for the trials we've been through
I'd never have the courage to come back to you
We're all entitled to make a mistake
We got to prepare for some heartbreak
I was earnin' my man while I was learnin' my man
Something you young girls might not understand

No pain (No pain), no pain (No pain)
No gain (No gain), no
No pain (No pain), no pain (No pain)
No gain (No gain)

There was an old lady sittin' under a tree
She called me over and she said to me
""My days left here may not be long
I wouldn't waste my time tellin' you nothin' wrong
But love is a flower that needs the sun and the rain
A little bit of pleasure's worth a whole lot of pain
If you learn this secret, how to forgive
A longer and a better life you'll live'

No pain (No pain), no pain (No pain)
No gain (No gain), mmm
No pain (No pain), no pain (No pain)
No gain (No gain)

Anything worth havin' at all
Is worth workin' for and waitin' for
Some of my closest friends
Have thought they had their thing on a string
Just 'cause their man was bringin' 'em flowers and candy and all kinds of gifts
Mmm, mmm, honey
Some gifts are just to make him feel better while he's on his guilt trip
About the night before
You know what I mean
Especially when you know you haven't been doin' the things you should do
Think about it
What is the man tryin' to tell you?
Sometimes flowers mean ""Maybe we should just be friends""
Do you get my drift?
Hang if you can hang
No pain, no gain

In order to get something
You got to give something
In order to be something
You got to go through something
Be a cook in the kitchen, a lady in the street
You can't show your teeth to every guy you meet
It's alright to be a little sweet
But be a mama with the kids and you know what in the sheets

No pain (No pain)
No pain (No pain)
No gain (No gain)
Oh, no pain (No pain)
No pain (No pain)
No gain (No gain)

See, you can't give up 'cause times get hard
It's just that old devil trying to keep us apart
Say, ""Devil, you ain't getting nothin' here
I'm holding on to my man and have no fear""

No pain (No pain), no pain (No pain)
No gain (No gain), oh
No pain (No pain), no pain (No pain)
No gain (No gain)

See, you can't give up 'cause times get hard

This loser since we’ve been apart
Now I call him a loser
Because even though we’re apart
That’s still my love
And no way he can win this
He may claim her now, that’s fine
But hey, check it out
It’s just a matter of time

It’s still my love
That’s still my love
That’s still my love
I’m gon’ say it again
You’re still my love
That’s still my love
That’s still my love

They say, they say
She’s found someone new
She’s supposed to be happy
But guess what
I don’t believe that's true
No, she just can’t be happy
You see, she can fool her friends
That’s the easy part
Oh, just wait, she can’t fool her heart

That’s still my love
It’s still my love
Oh, that’s still my love
I’m gonna say it
That’s still my love
That’s still, that’s still
That’s still my love, alright?

See I know my love, uh
And i just wanna say
It ain’t a faucet
You can’t turn it off when you want to
‘Cause love don’t work that way, no
For eyes that weep, there’s a heart that yearns
The girl’s been cryin’, it’s so healin’

That’s still my love
That’s still my love
Oh, that’s still my love
I’m gon’ say it again
That’s still my love
That’s still, that’s still
That’s still my love, alright?

Listen, she comes by here
When she wants what she wants
When she want it
That’s still my love
Oh, he don’t hear me
I said, she comes by here
When she needs what she needs
When she need it
That’s still my love
I’m gonna shout out loud

That’s still my love
That’s still my love
That’s still my love, alright?
For him, let me say
Brother, there just ain’t no way
That’s still my love, alright?

Though all our ups and downs
Though all our turnarounds
That’s still my love

Oh, baby
If you ever bail, baby
You know, you're still my love, alright?
You’re still my love
It’s still my love
That’s still my love
That’s still my love"

All of you ladies out there, turn up your radio
Girls, I'm about to tell you something, you may wanna know
You know things they're not always what they appear to be
And I don't want to happen to you, what happened to me

Listen
There are no words that can describe, what I felt inside
When I found out the man I loved, loved another guy
We were at a party, oh to have a little fun
But when I looked around my, my, my man was missing
I walked outside, I couldn't believe my eyes
He was in Bill's arms breathing hard and french kissing

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill that was sleeping with my man

Bill has been to my house a thousand times
He and my man would go camping and fishing
Oh I tell you it never crossed my mind
Bill was a friend and he was god-uncle to my only son
Now it looks Uncle Billy wants to be his step-mom

Now you see I was ready for Mary, I was ready for Jane
How do a woman compete with a man for another man

I asked my man ""Why didn't you tell me that you were gay?
When you knew, you knew I build my world around you""
And here's what he had to say
""I knew I had those feelings and I didn't want it to be
I thought by being with you, Girl I thought it would change me""
As tears came to my eyes, he says ""I'm sorry I hurt you so
But I got to pack, Bill is waiting for me, and oh girl I've got to, I've got to go""

I was ready for Barbara, Kim, Betty and Jane
When all the time it was Bill that was sleeping with my man

I don't feel ashamed, oh and I don't take the blame
My man was just a queen, he was a queen that thought, that thought he was a king
He told before he left he said ""I know you're hurt
Ooh, and oh I know, I know you're mad
But if that's not asking too much baby
Could you tell my son I love him and I'm still his dad""

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill that was sleeping with my man

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane (Bill used to come over to my house, I used to fix him my food)
When all the time it was Bill that was sleeping with my man (I used to loan Bill my money, all the time he was in there trying to get my honey)"

Stronger than steel it'll never change

Oh girl, all I'm trying to say is that my love has no limits and knows no bounds
And if you should look up one of these old days and find that there are fewer tomorrows than there are yesterdays
I don't want you to worry
And when father time reaches around life's corner and run his old gray fingers through your hair, my love will be there
And oh girl, if the years take away your figure and leave you disfigured
Don't worry, my love will still be there

I feel sorry, yeah, I feel sorry
I feel sorry, yeah, oh, I feel sorry
I feel sorry for any man out there
When he can't look around and say: ""This is my woman
And, my woman alone.""
I feel sorry, yeah, for any woman out there
Who can't say: ""I got somebody I can call my very own""
I feel sorry, I feel sorry, I feel sorry, I feel sorry

One thing I can say about the people of the world, today
They see you with a good thing, they wanna take it away

But, I believe in you
You believe in me, too, yeah

Even your best friend can come around
Making sly remarks, trying to put you down

I believe in you
You believe in me, too
Listen honey

People are talkin', trying to pull us apart
Stickin' pins and needles in both of our hearts
Our love is together, don't care about no stormy weather

I believe in you
(I believe in you. Do you, do you)
You believe in me, too
(Do you believe in me, too?)
Look, honey

I heard your mother say loving me didn't make no sense
But, when she put me down, you stood up in my defense

I believe in you
(I believe in you. Do you, do you)
Anytime you go against your own mother, that makes me know: You believe in me, too (Do you believe in me, too?)
Here's another thing

We had our hard time, and almost didn't make it
Always worked it out and never tried to fake it

I believe in you
(I believe in you. Do you, do you)
You believe in me, too
(Do you believe in me, too?)
Here's another thing about it

People talkin', trying to pull us apart, no
Always stickin' pins and needles in both of our hearts
But, our love is together, don't care about no stormy weather

I believe in you
(I believe in you. Do you, do you)
You believe in me, too, yeah
(Do you believe in me, too?)

I believe
That's why everytime we get a chance, I tell ya, honey
How much I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
And, most of all, how much I trust you
The reason why I trust you, baby, is become of one thing:
I can lean on you, yeah
And you can lean on me, too
One more thing I wanna say

I believe
(I believe in you. Do you, do you)
Honey, please, let me believe in you
(Do you believe in me, too?)
I know a lot of folk out there wish they had somebody they could believe in
(I believe in you. Do you, do you)
Oh, I believe, I believe
(Do you believe in me, too?)
In you. You believe in me, too
(I believe in you. Do you, do you)
Anytime you stand against your own mother
(Do you believe in me, too?)
That makes me know that I
(I believe in you, Do you, do you)
Can believe in you, I believe in you
(Do you believe in me, too?)
And you've shown me enough to know that you believe in me too"

Ah, she didn't bat an eye
As I packed my bags to leave
I thought she would start to cry
Or sit around my room and grieve
But y'all, the girl
She fooled me this time
She acted like I was the last thing on her mind
I would like to start all over again

Baby, can I change my mind?
I just wanna change my mind
Baby, let me change my mind

As I took those steps
Toward that open door
Knowing all the time
Oh, Lord, I just didn't wanna go
But she didn't give me no sign
Nothin' that would make me change my mind
I would like to start all over again

Baby, can I change my mind?
Please, please, please, baby
I just wanna change my mind

Oh, I played my games
Many times before
But, peoples, let me tell y'all
Oh, I never reached the door
But, ooh, the wind is howl tonight
I keep lookin' back, but my baby's not in sight
I would like to start all over again

I kept on like a ramblin' fool
Stayed in trouble all the time
Got put behind bars yeah
Spent two years on a county line

Life ain't no good at all
Behind these county walls
Broke down three days ago
Whoa oh, wasn't where I recall

And how can I slow down
When I can't stop runnin'
My own shadow scares me to death

Got caught down in Alabam'
When one of those sheriffs come around
They caught me in the bed
With the county sheriff's wife

And how can I slow down
When I can't stop runnin'
My own shadow scares me to death


Got caught down in Alabam'
With one of those sheriffs come around
They caught me in the bed

And how can I slow down

Hello, may I speak to Barbara
Barbara, this is Shirley
You might not know who I am
But the reason I am calling you is because
I was going through my
Old man's pockets this morning
And I just happened to find your name and number
So woman to woman
I don't think it's being anymore than fair
To call you and let you know
Where I'm coming from
Now Barbara
I don't know how you're gonna take this
But whether you be cool
Or come out of a bag on me
You see it doesn't really make any difference
But it's only fair that I let you know that
The man you're in love with
He's mine
From the top of his head
To the bottom of his feet
The bed he sleeps in
And every piece of food he eats

You see, I make it possible
The clothes on his back
Ha ha, I buy them
The car he drives
I pay the note every month
So I'm telling you these things
To let you know how much I love that man
And woman to woman
I think you'll understand
How much I'll do to keep him
Woman to woman
If you've ever been in love
Then you know how I feel
And woman to woman
Now, if you were in my shoes
Wouldn't you have done the same thing too
Oh, oh, woman to woman
Can't you see where I'm coming from
Woman to woman
Ain't that the same thing you would've done
Woman to woman
Now should I just step aside
And let her take what's rightfully mine

Oh, oh, woman to woman
Was I right or was I wrong
I ain't gonna let you break up my happy home
Now woman to woman
Now you see I don't want no trouble now
I hope you understand
I love that man and he's mine
I'm talking to you
Woman to woman
You should be woman enough to understand
That man, I love that man
Woman, woman
Woman to woman, he's mine
And I ain't gonna give him up
My baby, I ain't lying, now"

You know I was talking to this girl the other day, right
And she said ""J-Wonn, what kinda girl you like?""
Well, I said ""I like me a daddy's girl, baby doll""
And let me tell you why

'Cause she gon' know how to treat me
She gon' know how to care for me
Oh, that girl's gonna love me
All I need is a daddy's girl
'Cause she gon' know how to treat me
She gon' know how to care for me
She's gonna love me
All I need is a daddy's girl (Listen)

A daddy gon' show his daughter how to first love herself
He's gonna tell his daughter to respect everybody else, now-now
Gonna show her the difference between a player and a real man
'Cause when I say I love her, she truly understands

Now I'ma do for her, and she gon' know how to do for me

'Cause she gon' know how to treat me
She gon' know how to care for me
Oh, that girl's gonna love me
All I need is a daddy's girl
'Cause she gon' know how to treat me
She gon' know how to care for me
She's gonna love me
All I need is a daddy's girl (All I need)

He's gonna tell his daughter ""Never judge a book his cover"", no (No, no-no, no-no)
Just because a man look good, he may be nothing but trouble
Make sure that he treats you like the queen that you are
Make sure it's unconditional love, and y'all will go very far

Listen, now that man gon' make some mistakes
But you gotta know how to forgive

'Cause she gon' know how to treat me
She gon' know how to care for me
Oh, that girl's gonna love me
All I need is a daddy's girl
'Cause she gon' know how to treat me
She gon' know how to care for me
She's gonna love me
All I need is a daddy's girl (All I need)

Never let that man call you out your name, no
'Cause if you stick around, he's gonna drive you insane
And if he ever, ever, ever lay one hand on you, darling
Just call on your daddy, he'll be right there to save you

Listen, now if he payin' all them bills
And takin' care of the kids

'Cause she gon' know how to treat me (That's all I need, all I need, all I need, yeah)
She gon' know how to care for me (Give me a daddy's girl)
Oh, that girl's gonna love me (She's gonna love me, she's gonna love me)
All I need is a daddy's girl (All I need)
'Cause she gon' know how to treat me (She gonna know how to treat me)
She gon' know how to care for me
She's gonna love me
All I need is a daddy's girl (All I need)

Give me a daddy's girl
That's all J-Wonn needs
If you out there somewhere, darling
I need a daddy's girl"

Hey baby, I know I'm gonna miss you
But don't worry 'bout it
I'll be back soon
And when I get back

I'm gon' kiss you where I miss you
I'm gon' squeeze you, girl and tease you

Oh, when I go on my business trips
And leave you lyin' there all alone (I don't like it)
The only thing I can think of, baby
Is comin' back home, ooh-wee
I can see you standin' there, yeah
And that pretty pink negligee (Lookin' good)
I start to smile, 'cause i know right then
It's gonna be a lovely day, yeah

I wish I could be home twenty-four hours a day
We both know the bills have got to be paid
Now when I get home, there won't be much talkin'
I'm gonna let my tongue do the walkin'

I'm gon' kiss you where I miss you
I'm gon' squeeze you, girl, and tease you
I'm gon' kiss you where I miss you
I'm gon' hold you and console you
Well

Oh, sometime when the ladies approach me
I notice that they soon turn away
All I do is talk about you, baby
They don't have have much to say, no (Stop talkin')
I got all the woman I need in you
I don't have to search no more
But keep on lovin' me like you doin', baby
And I'll never-never-never get bored, no

I wish I could be home twenty-four hours a day

You know ladies, this the thing about men
You know they always wanna leave you, but they always seem to come back again
But this particular time, I heard through the grapevine that he didn’t want me anymore
So ima take it how it come baby
I wanna tell a story, check this out:
For the last 7 years, I put my life on hold thinking you gon love me, but you always seem like you gotta go, loving another woman while I’m loving you, I can’t take it no more, so I gotta cut you loose
He don’t love me, aw, aw no he don’t, but he can’t stand to see me with another man
I ain't lying, not this time
He don’t want me, aw, aw no he don’t, but can’t stand to see me with another man
That ain't right, that ain't right
I woke up this morning with a strange, strange feeling
I checked my answering service ""will you marry me”
It was you on the other line willing to be my husband and I’ll be your wife
But things won’t change; you continue to stay gone all night
He don’t love me, aw, aw no he don’t, but he can’t stand to see me with another man
I ain't lying, not this time
He don’t want me, aw, aw no he don’t, but can’t stand to see me with another man
That ain't right, that ain't right
I finally found somebody who loves me like I loved you
So don't get mad at me baby for what I’m about to say and do
He put a ring on my finger, now you’re mad at the world, but you can’t go stepping out, stepping in, stepping in, stepping out, I don’t wanna be your girl
He don’t love me, aw, aw no he don’t, but he can’t stand to see me with another man
I ain't lying, not this time
He don’t want me, aw, aw no he don’t, but can’t stand to see me with another man
That ain't right, that ain't right
I finally found somebody who ain't got nobody, that needs somebody ‘cause everybody needs somebody"

Sure lover, sweet thing
I've reached the I've reached the turning point in my life

I used to stay out all night long
Used to do a whole lot of wrong
And I don't know where I would a-end up
If that sweet thing hadn't come along
Said that sweet thing hadn't come along

No more running around for me
Finally settling down
I've reached the I've reached the turning point

(Mmmhmm-mmmhmm-mmmhmm)

I met a girl
She's one out of a hundred and ten
And she don't get exited, no-no
By those slick talking men
She's a wiz around the house
Neat as a pin
If I got a hole in my sock, got a hole in my shirt
Sweet thing, she'll mend

No more staying out late for me
No more narrow escapes
I've reached the turning point
(I've reached the turning point) In my life

Wake up, little darling
It's time to go home
If sunrise catch us sleeping
We'll be caught up in the wrong
Last time we were together
You made it home in
Just the nick of time
We got so much love between us
It's getting hard to meet the deadline

We're getting careless with our love
We're getting careless with our love
So careless with our love affair

Wake up, little darling
Because time, it won't stand still
Going home to someone
You don't love no more
I know it's against your will
I hate to see you leave
With tears all over your face
Just like Sherlock Holmes
The whole world is on our case

We're getting careless with our love
I can't help but get careless with our love
We're getting careless with our love affair

Some people say that it's wrong
But it's the only love we know
And it keeps on getting strong
Everytime we see each other
Our love gets a little stronger
That's why I don't want you to leave
I wanna hold you a little longer

We're getting careless with our love
I can't help but get careless with our love
We're getting careless with our love affair

Lord, have mercy now
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
I think we better find, I think
We better find another meeting place
Before the whole world is gonna know
We might mess around
And make a disgrace
You see, honey
The rumors are spreading
The rumors are spreading all over town
And we don't wanna be like Mrs. Jones
We can't meet at the same place
Every time I see you, baby
I know other folk can see that
Look that we have in our eyes
Yeah, when you see me
You're supposed to walk on by
But I can feel it in my heart
That we're getting careless
Careless, careless, careless

We're getting careless
We're getting careless
Careless, careless, careless
Careless, careless , yeah
We're getting careless
Careless, careless, careless
We're getting so careless"

Knocking on my door
Looking so good, I just can’t ignore
You wanted me to take you back
Start all over again
The hurt is so deep
I know you’ll understand
Chorus
Too many memories
And they’re just killing me
Baby
Too many memories (Too many memories)
And they’re just killing me
Ooooh yeahhh…
You say you want to come in
Sit down and talk for awhile
Girl the sweet smell of your perfume
Is still driving me wild
The closer you get
The longer you stay
Makes it harder and harder
For me to stay away

Too many memories (That’s What it is baby)
And they’re just killing me (Whooooa)
Too many memories
And they’re just killing me (ooooo nah nah- hey)
Too many memories
And they’re just killing me
Too many memories (that’s what it is girl)
And they’re just killing me

You say that you still love me
And you want to start anew
Deep down in my heart, baby I do, too
Let me take your coat
Put your suitcase on the floor
Cause I’m no longer afraid
To let my feelings flow
Too many memories
Of how it used to be
Too many memories
When you belonged to me (yeah You see honey)
(I’ve go to so many memories) Too many memories
Of how it used to be (ooo wee Girl)
Too many memories (Too many memories)
When you belonged to me (I don’t know what to do about it baby)

Too many memories (don’t you see)
Of how it used to be
Too many memories
When you belonged to me"

I don't know where to turn
I've been loved by two woman
One is my wife, the other one is my woman, listen to me
And just when you thought of leaving either one of them
Would really blow their mind
Oh listen, my wife she's silky black
And she's a pretty thing
And my woman is such a lovely brown, oh
Ya'll, I'm stuck, stuck in the middle
Stuck, stuck in the middle
I don't know where to turn, oh listen to me
My wife, she said she's mine, oh yes, she did
She said she's mine, mine until death do us apart
Listen what my woman said, my woman said
She's mine also because I live everyday within your heart, oh
Ya'll, I'm stuck, stuck in the middle
Stuck, stuck in the middle
Stuck, stuck in the middle
Stuck, stuck in the middle

If I leave my wife for my woman, oh I know
I know, I know my wife won't understand that, no she won't
And if I leave my woman for my wife, oh, I know
I know, I know my woman won't understand me no more
Ya'll, I'm stuck, stuck in the middle
Stuck, stuck in the middle
You know I was talking to my wife the other day
And she said, ""Marvin, do you remember
The vow you made when we got married"", and I said, ""Yes""
""Well, do you remember the minister asking you these words""
'Do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?'
Oh, I never will forget to love, to honor, to cherish
Till death do you apart, she said, ""Marvin you said, yes""
She said, ""Please don't leave me Marvin""
But I've moved on and began to talk to my woman
I never will forget this
She said, ""Marvin when you were doing bad
When all your friends turned against you""
She said, I stuck by you Marvin
It was me, please don't leave me""
I just stood there with tears in my eyes
I never will forget it, you know what I said

Ya'll, I'm stuck, stuck in the middle
Stuck, stuck in the middle
Stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck in the middle"

Time to get off
Let's get it on
Anytime you're in the mood to groove
Give me a call
Just say the word, I'll be right there
Baby, I'm gonna fill you up with tender love and care
It's all to make you feel good
To carry you to ecstasy
If you give me directions, communicate to me, baby

Baby, tell me where do you want me to put it
If you want me to get it right
Tell me what should I do with it
'Cause you're starting to work it down
And I don't want to lose it
Baby, tell me where do you want me to put it

It's time to come closer
'Cause we got the urge
So baby, can we do it once or twice just to rehearse
When can we work it out?
When can we work it out?
Or do you like it when I get my groove on
'Round and around and around and around

It's all to make you feel good
And love even the blind can see
If you're giving direction, communicate to me

Baby, tell me where do you want me to put it
If you want me to get it right
Tell me what should I do with it
'Cause you're starting to work it down
And I don't want to lose it
Baby, tell me where do you want me to put it

If it feels good to you, say ""yeah""
Ah yeah, it feels good
(Feels so good to me)
Ah yeah, it feels good
(Oh, it sho'nuff feels real good)

All the way down
We're going down
Where did you want me to put it? (Down)

Is it right here? (Is it over there?)
Is it where you want it? (Baby, I don't care)
When we're making love, I love to get you warm

Baby, tell me where do you want me to put it
If you want me to get it right
Tell me what should I do with it
