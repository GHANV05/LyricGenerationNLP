I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'ma set it straight, this Watergate
I can't stand rockin' when I'm in here
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fuckin' thorn in my side
Oh my God, it's a mirage
I'm telling y'all, it's sabotage

So, so, so, so listen up, 'cause you can't say nothin'
You shut me down with a push of your button
But, yo, I'm out, and I'm gone
I'll tell you now, I keep it on and on

'Cause what you see, you might not get
And we can bet, so don't you get souped yet
Scheming on a thing, that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now, it's sabotage

Why?
(Our backs are now against the wall)

Listen, all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen, all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen, all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen, all y'all, it's a sabotage

I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'ma set it straight, this Watergate
But I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be? It's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage"

Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
I came to win, battle me, that's a sin
I won't ever slack up, punk, ya better back up
Try and play the role and yo, the whole crew'll act up
Get up, stand up, (C'mon!) c'mon, throw your hands up
If ya got the feelin', jump up, touch the ceilin'
Muggs let the funk flow, someone's talkin' junk
Yo, I bust him in the eye and then I'll take the punk's ho
Feelin', funkin', amps in the trunk, and
I got more rhymes than there's cops at a Dunkin' donuts shop
Sho' nuff, I got props
From the kids on the Hill plus my mom and my pops

I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around

I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smackin' the ho
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son, I've returned
Anyone steppin' to me, you'll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none
If you come to battle, bring a shotgun (Shotgun)
But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death
Tryin' to step to me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skill, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to kill

I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around

Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Tryin' to play me out like as if my name was Sega
But I ain't goin' out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and yo, and I might switch
It up, up and around, then buck, buck you down
Put out your head and then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm comin' to get ya, I'm comin' to get ya
Spittin' out lyrics, homie, I'll wet ya

Glancin' the kid, wishing they was dancin' a jig

In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, uh
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad 'cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty-yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali—he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bump my hits and watch them go off, a-go off
Ah, yes-yes y'all (Woo), ya don't stop

Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from South Street to one-two-fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
C.R.E.A.M. to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill, but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly

C'mon, man
And with the local DBC news
LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
Word (But tonight—)

Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
I'm rocking my peers, putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions, overpowering
Over the competition, I'm towering
Wrecking shop when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying the price

I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)

Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Muhammad Ali, they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
That you know I had beef with
Why do you riff with me? The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready 'cause it might go blaow
How ya like me now?
The Ripper will not allow
You to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blasting, outlasting
Kinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh), breakdown

Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Yeah)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Yeah)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Uh)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Huh)

Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio
Uh, I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new tour
I'm going insane
Starting the hurricane, releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain
I maintain unless ya say my name
Ripping, killing, digging and drilling a hole
Pass the ol' gold

I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)

Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill at will
The man of the hour, tower of power
I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you
Understand that I'm not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
Damn
Ooh, listen to the way I slay
Your crew
Damage, uh, damage, uh
Damage, uh, damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy-soft sucka, I'll slay him
Farmers (What?) Farmers (What?)
I'm ready (We ready)
I think I'm gonna bomb a town (Get down)
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
'Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock hard

Knock you out
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)

Blood sugar sucker fish in my dish
How many pieces do you wish
Step into a heaven where I keep it on the soul side
Girl, please me, be my soul bride
Every woman has a piece of Aphrodite
Copulate to create a state of sexual light
Kissing her virginity, my affinity
I mingle with the gods, I mingle with divinity

Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar crazy, she has it
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik

Glorious euphoria is my must
Erotic shock is a function of lust
Temporarily blind, dimension to discover
In time, each into the other
Uncontrollable notes from her snow-white throat
Fill a space in which two bodies float
Operatic by voice, a fanatic by choice
Aromatic is the flower, she must be moist

Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar crazy, she has it
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby, she magik

Hey, batter-batter, hey, batter, hey, batter-batter
Hey, batter-batter, hey, batter, hey, batter-batter
Hey, batter-batter
Swing!

I got a soul that cannot sleep at night
When something just ain't right, ya
Blood red, but without sight
Exploding egos in the night
Mix like sticks of dynamite
Red, black or white, this is my fight
Oh, come on, courage, let's be heard
Turn feelings into word
American equality has always been sour
An attitude I would like to devour
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power?

Power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be (Ought to be)
It fills me up like a hollow tree (Hollow tree)
The power of equality

Right or wrong, my song is strong
You don't like it, get along
Say what I want, do what I can
Death to the message of the Ku-Klux-Klan
I don't buy supremacy
A media chief, you menace me
The people you say cause all the crime
Wake up, motherfucker and smell the slime
Blackest anger, whitest fear
Can you hear me, am I clear?
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power?

Power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be (Ought to be)
It fills me up like a hollow tree (Hollow tree)
The power of equality


Well, I got tapes, I got CD's
I got my Public Enemy
A lily white ass is tickled pink
When I listen to the music that makes me think
Not another motherfuckin' politician
Doin' nothin' but something for his own ambition
I'll never touch the sound we make
Soul sacred love, vows that we take
To create straight what is true
Yo, he's with me and what I do
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power?

Power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be (Ought to be)
It fills me up like a hollow tree (Hollow tree)
The power of equality

Madder than a motherfucker, lick my finger
Can't forget, 'cause the memory linger
Count 'em off quick, little Piccadilly sickness
Take me to the hick or eat my thickness
I got a welt from the Bible belt
A-dealin' with the hand that I've been dealt
I'm sittin' in the grip of a killing fist
I'm givin' up blood just to exist
Rub me wrong and I get pissed
I know I, I can not get to this
People in pain, I do not dig it
A change of brain for Mr. Bigot

Little brother, do you hear me?
Have a heart, oh, come get near me
Misery is not my friend
But I'll break before I bend
What I see is insanity
Whatever happened to humanity?
Whatever happened to humanity?
Whatever happened to humanity?"

Before the story begins
Is it such a sin
For me to take what's mine
Until the end of time?
We were more than friends
Before the story ends
And I will take what's mine
Create what God would never design

Our love had been so strong for far too long
I was weak with fear that somethin' would go wrong
Before the possibilities came true
I took all possibility from you
Almost laughed myself to tears (Ahahaha)
Conjuring her deepest fears (Come here, you fuckin' bitch)

Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it, eat it, eat it
She was never this good in bed even when she was sleepin'
Now she's just so perfect, I've never been quite so fuckin' deep in

It goes on and on and on
I can keep you lookin' young and preserved forever
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know
I know it's not your time but bye-bye
And a word to the wise, when the fire dies
You think it's over, but it's just begun
Baby, don't cry

You had my heart
At least for the most part (Ah-ah, ah)
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart
Let's make a new start (Ah-ah, ah)
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah-yeah
But baby, don't cry

Now possibilities I'd never considered
Are occurring to the likes of which I'd never heard
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
To repossess a body with which I misbehave
Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears

Must have stabbed him fifty fuckin' times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it, eat it, eat it (Eat the shit out of it)
Now that it's done, I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave

I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know
I know it's not your time but bye-bye
And a word to the wise, when the fire dies
You think it's over, but it's just begun
But baby, don't cry

You had my heart
At least for the most part (Ah-ah-ah)
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart
Let's make a new start (Ah-ah-ah)
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah-yeah
But baby, don't cry

(What will you do?) I will suffer for so long
(Not long enough) To make it up to you
(I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do
(Well, then I'll grant you one chance)
And if it's not enough (It's not enough, if it's not enough)
If it's not enough (Not enough), try again (Try again)
And again (And again), over and over again

We're coming back, coming back
We'll live forever, live forever
Let's have a wedding, have a wedding
Let's start the killing, start the killing

Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
(Yes, I do)
Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
(I do)
I now pronounce you—

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know
I know it's not your time but bye-bye
And a word to the wise, when the fire dies
You think it's over, but it's just begun
But baby, don't cry

You had my heart
At least for the most part (Ah-ah-ah)
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart
Let's make a new start (Ah-ah-ah)
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah-yeah
But baby, don't cry"

But that's the way I like it, baby, I don't wanna live forever
And don't forget the joker

Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again
I see it in your eyes, take one look and die
The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be

With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin'

The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger

Not need, just feed the war, cannibal animal, I
Walk the corner to the rubble
That used to be a library, line up to the mind cemetery now
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally 'round the family, pockets full of shells

I don't practice Santeria, I ain't got no crystal ball
Well, I had a million dollars, but I'd, I'd spend it all
If I could find that jaina and that Sancho that she's found
Well, I'd pop a cap in Sancho and I'd slap her down

What I really wanna know, ah, baby, mmm
What I really want to say, I can't define
Well, it's love that I need, oh
My soul will have to

Wait 'til I get back, find a jaina of my own
Daddy's gonna love one and all
I feel the break, feel the break, feel the break, and I got' live it up
Oh, yeah, ah-huh, well, I swear that I

What I really wanna know, ah, baby
What I really want to say, I can't define
That love, make it go
My soul will have to

Mmm, what I really wanna say, ah, baby
What I really wanna say is, ""I've got mine
And I'll make it, oh yes, I'm comin' up""
Tell Sanchito that

If he knows what is good for him, he best go run and hide
Daddy's got a new .45
And I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down Sancho's throat
Believe me when I say that I got something for his punk ass

What I really wanna know, my baby
Ooh, what I really wanna say is, ""There's just one""
Way back, and I'll make it, oh yeah I'm coming up
My soul will have to wait yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah"

Fuck, you can't even sing

Early in the mornin', risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet
Got to find the reason, reason things went wrong
Got to find the reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot

Well, life is (Too short), so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static, I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty
Love is what I got, it's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve
Try and test that, you're bound to get served
Love's what I got, don't start a riot
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot

Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
And remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
(I got, I got, I got)

Why I don't cry when my dog runs away
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Fuckin' and fightin'; it's all the same
Living with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

'Cause lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
And remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got
(I got, I got, I got)

We're not that far off
So, that's
See, but
We're done, man"

Annie's twelve years old, in two more, she'll be a whore
Nobody ever told her it's the wrong way
Don't be afraid with the quickness you get laid
For your family, get paid, it's the wrong way

I gave her all that I had to give
I'm gonna make it hard to live
Salty tears running down to her chin
And it ruins up her makeup and never wan' give

A cigarette pressed between her lips
But I'm staring at her tits, it's the wrong way
Strong if I can, but I am only a man
So I take her to the can, it's the wrong way

The only family that she's ever had
Is her seven horny brothers and a drunk-ass dad
He needed money, so he put her on the street
Everything was going fine, until the day she met me

Happy are you sad, wanna shoot your dad?
I'll do anything I can, the wrong way
We talk all night, tried to make it right
Believe me, shit was tight, it was the wrong way

Don't run away, if you wanna stay
'Cause I ain't here to make you, oh, no
It's up to you what you really want to do
Spend some time in America
Dub style!


She'll give you all that she's got to give
But I'm gonna make it hard to live
Big, salty tears rolling down to her chin
And it smears up her makeup an' never wan' give

So, we ran away and I'm sorry when I say
That straight to this very day it was the wrong way
She did the hike, don't matter if I like it, or not
Because she only wants the wrong way

I gave her all that I had to give
She still wouldn't take it, whoa, no
Her two brown eyes are leaking like a sieve
And it still ruins her makeup, and never wan' give"

Had a drink about an hour ago
Sittin' in a corner by herself
In a bar in downtown hell
She heard a noise and she looked to the door
And saw a man she'd never seen before
Light skin, light blue eyes
A double chin and a plastic smile, well
Her heart raced as he walked in the door
And took an empty seat next to her at the bar
A brand new car was parked right outside
""How'd you like to go for a ride?""
And she said, ""Wait a minute, I have to think""
He said, ""That's fine, may I please buy you a drink?""
One drink turned into three or four
And they left and got into his car
And they drove away some place real far
""Now, babe, the time has come
How'd you like to have a little fun?""
And she said, ""If we could only please be on our way, I would not run""
That's when things got out of control

She didn't want to, he had his way
She said ""Let's go,"" He said ""No way""
""Come on, babe, it's your lucky day
Shut your mouth, we're gonna do it my way
Come on, baby, don't be afraid
If it wasn't for date rape, I'd never get laid""
He finished up, he started the car
He turned around and drove back to the bar
He said, ""Now, baby, don't be sad
In my opinion, you weren't half bad""
She picked up a rock, threw it at the car
Hit him in the head, now he's got a big scar
Come on, party people, won't you listen to me
Date rape story
Next day, she went to her drawer
Looked up her local attorney-at-law
Went to the phone and filed a police report
And then she took the guy's ass to court
Well, the day he stood in front of the judge
He screamed, ""She lies, that little slut""
The judge knew he was full of shit
And he gave him twenty-five years
Now his heart is filled with tears

One night in jail, it was getting late
He was butt-raped by a large inmate
And he screamed
But the guards paid no attention to his cries
That's when things got out of control
The moral of the date rape story
It does not pay to be drunk and horny
But that's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind
Even though he now takes it in the behind
That's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind
Even though he now takes it in the behind
Date rape
She didn't want to
She didn't want to
She didn't want to
She didn't want to take it"

Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication

It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication

Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station??
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there, and I don't mean on vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication


Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication"

Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am, together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

Yeah, yeah, yeah

It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love, the city she loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunkt, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

White heat is screamin' in the jungle (Oh, oh-oh)
Complete the motion if you stumble (Oh-oh)
Go ask the dust for any answers (Oh-oh)
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

This chapter's gonna be a close one (Oh, oh-oh)
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one (Oh-oh)
All on a spaceship, persevering (Oh-oh)
Use my hands for everything but steering

Can't stop the spirits when they need you (Oh, oh-oh)
Mop tops are happy when they feed you (Oh-oh)
J. Butterfly is in the treetop (Oh-oh)
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute, I'm passin' out, win or lose
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

Your image in the dictionary

Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades

Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder to tell what came first, um
Underwater where thoughts can breathe easily
Far away you were made in a sea, just like me

Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything

Staring straight up into the sky, oh, my, my
A solar system that fits in your eye, microcosm
You could die but you're never dead, spider web
Take a look at the stars in your head, fields of space kid

Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything


Psychic changes are born in your heart, entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same, bless your heart, girl
Kill the pressure it's raining on salty cheeks
When you hear the beloved song, I am with you

Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything"

Like walkin' into a dream
So unlike what you've seen
So unsure, but it seems
'Cause we've been waitin' for you
Fallen into this place
Just givin' you a small taste
Of your afterlife here, so stay
You'll be back here soon anyway
I see a distant light
But girl, this can't be right
Such a surreal place to see
So how did this come to be?
Arrived too early

And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life, and realize this is going too far

I don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time, I'm right
To move on and on
Far away from here

Place of hope and no pain
Perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place, but refrain
'Cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place
Just givin' you a small taste
Of your afterlife here, so stay
You'll be back here soon anyway
This peace on Earth's not right
(Up with my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time
(I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place, don't wanna stay
I feel wrong, and that's my sign
I've made up my mind

Gave me your hand, but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand, I have to leave and carry on my own life

I don't belong here, I gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time, I'm right
To move on and on
Far away from here
Got nothing against you, and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hoped you might
Take me back inside
When the time is right

Loved ones back home all cryin' 'cause they're already missin' me
I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be
(I am unbroken, I'm chokin' on this ecstasy)
Oh, Lord, I'll try so hard, but you gotta let go of me
(Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another chance to live! Ah!)

I don't belong here, I gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time, I'm right
To move on and on
Far away from here
Got nothing against you, and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hoped you might
Take me back inside

A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find
While I recall all the words you spoke to me
Can't help but wish that I was there
At where I'd love to be, oh yeah

Dear God, the only thing I ask of You
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need that person who can be true to you
But I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again, oh no
Once again

There's nothing here for me, on this barren road
There's no one here while the city sleeps
And all the shops are closed
Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah

Dear God, the only thing I ask of You
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need that person who can be true to you
But I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again, oh no
Once again

Well, some search, never finding a way
Before long, they waste away
I found you, something told me to stay
I gave in, to selfish ways
And how I miss someone to hold
When hope begins to fade

A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find

Dear God, the only thing I ask of You
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away

I feel insane every single time I'm asked to compromise
'Cause I'm afraid and stuck in my ways, and that's the way it stays
So how long did I expect love to outweigh ignorance?
By that look on your face, I may have forced the scale to tip

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

(Mother) Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Said it all) Come back again, it's almost easy

Shame pulses through my heart from the things I've done to you
It's hard to face, but the fact remains that this is nothing new
I left you bound and tied with suicidal memories
Selfish beneath the skin, but deep inside, I'm not insane

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

(Mother) Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Said it all) Come back again, it's almost easy
(You'll learn your lesson) Come back to me, it's almost easy
(But first you'll fall) Come back again, it's almost easy


Now that I've lost you, it kills me to say (Hurts to say)
I've tried to hold on as you've slowly slipped away
I'm losing the fight, I've treated you so wrong
Now let me make it right (Make it all right)

I'm not insane, I'm not insane, hahahahaha
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

(Mother) Come back to me, it's almost easy

Shh! Quiet, you might piss somebody off!
Like me, motherfucker, you've been at it for too long
While you feed off others' insecurities
You stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds

Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds, but not for fellow men
(Broken glass, your fake reflection)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone

So how does it feel to know that someone's kid in the heart of America has blood on their hands fighting to defend your rights so you can maintain the lifestyle that insults his family's existence?
Well, where I'm from we have a special salute
We aim high in the air towards all those pompous assholes who spend their days pointing fingers
(Fuck you!)

Shh! Quiet, you might piss somebody off
Like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long
You'll be damned if you count me in as part of your
Generous hypocrisy, collecting enemies

Tabloid gossip queen, worthless man
(There's no need for us to bury you)
Selfish agenda once again
(Right this way, you dug your own grave)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone

All the way from the east to the west, we got this high society lookin' down on their very foundation
Constantly reminding us that our actions are the cause of all their problems
Pointing their fingers in every direction
Blamin' their own nation for who wins elections
They've never contributed a fuckin' thing to the country they love to criticize

Excuse the obscene, ignore the untrue
Depictions we see try and get through
Admitting mistakes can hurt
I'm not the last, but I sure ain't the first

Hey! (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Shh! Quiet, you might piss somebody off
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)


Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds, but not for fellow men
(Broken glass, your fake reflection)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone"

And the meek shall inherit the earth

We've taken care of everything
The words you read, the songs you sing
The pictures that give pleasure to your eye
It's one for all, and all for one
We work together, common son
Never need to wonder how or why

We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls
We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx
All the gifts of life are held within our walls

Look around at this world we've made
Equality, our stock-in-trade
Come and join the Brotherhood of Man
Oh, what a nice, contented world
Let the banners be unfurled
Hold the Red Star proudly high in hand

We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls
We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx
All the gifts of life are held within our walls


What can this strange device be?
When I touch it, it gives forth a sound
It's got wires that vibrate and give music
What can this thing be that I found?

See how it sings like a sad heart
And joyously screams out its pain
Sounds that build high like a mountain
Or notes that fall gently like rain

I can't wait to share this new wonder
The people will all see its light
Let them all make their own music
The Priests praise my name on this night


I know it's most unusual to come before you so
But I've found an ancient miracle
I thought that you should know
Listen to my music and hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you

Yes, we know, it's nothing new, it's just a waste of time
We have no need for ancient ways, the world is doing fine
Another toy that helped destroy the elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim, it doesn't fit the plan, no

I can't believe you're saying these things just can't be true
Our world could use this beauty, just think what we might do
Listen to my music and hear what it can do
There's something here that's as strong as life
I know that it will reach you

Don't annoy us further! Oh, we have our work to do
Just think about the average, what use have they for you?
Another toy that helped destroy the elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim, it doesn't fit the plan!



I wandered home through silent streets
And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night
Dream, can't you show me the light?

I stand atop a spiral stair, an oracle confronts me there
He leads me on light years away
Through astral nights, galactic days
I see the works of gifted hands
That grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise with hungry mind and open eyes

They left our planets long ago
The elder race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home where they belong
Home to tear the Temples down,  home to change!

The sleep is still in my eyes, the dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile and lie awhile in bed
I wish that it might come to pass, not fade like all my dreams

Just think of what my life might be in a world like I have seen!
I don't think I can carry on, carry on this cold and empty life
Oh, no!


My spirits are low in the depths of despair
My lifeblood… spills over

Sprawling on the fringes of the city
In geometric order
An insulated border
In between the bright lights
And the far unlit unknown

Growing up, it all seems so one-sided
Opinions all provided
The future pre-decided
Detached and subdivided
In the mass production zone
Nowhere is the dreamer or the misfit so alone
(Subdivisions)—
In the high school halls
In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out
(Subdivisions)—
In the basement bars
In the backs of cars
Be cool or be cast out

Any escape might help to smooth
The unattractive truth
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe
The restless dreams of youth


Drawn like moths, we drift into the city
The timeless old attraction
Cruising for the action
Lit up like a firefly
Just to feel the living night

Some will sell their dreams for small desires
Or lose the race to rats
Get caught in ticking traps
And start to dream of somewhere
To relax their restless flight
Somewhere out of a memory
Of lighted streets on quiet nights
(Subdivisions)—
In the high school halls
In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out
(Subdivisions)—
In the basement bars
In the backs of cars
Be cool or be cast out

Any escape might help to smooth
The unattractive truth
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe
The restless dreams of youth"

I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand, I would understand

The angry boy a bit too insane
Icing over a secret pain
You know you don't belong
You're the first to fight, you're way too loud
You're the flash of light on a burial shroud
I know something's wrong
Well, everyone I know has got a reason
To say, ""Put the past away""

I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand, I would understand

Well, he's on the table and he's gone to code
And I do not think anyone knows
What they're doing here
And your friends have left you, you've been dismissed
I never thought it would come to this
And I, I want you to know
Everyone's got to face down the demons
Maybe today, you could put the past away

I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand, I would understand
I would understand

I would understand
I would understand
I would understand


Can you put the past away?
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
And I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend

And I wanna feel it, too

And it makes me feel so fine

You don't need no memory
Just a place to call your own
As we drift into the zone

On an island in the sun

And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain

We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore

Met a girl, thought she was grand
Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued

In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fucking hates me
Trust
She fucking hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

She was queen for about an hour
After that, shit got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt
No feeling of bad, no

In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fucking hates me
Trust
She fucking hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

That's my story, as you see
Learned my lesson and so did she
Now it's over and I'm glad
Cause I'm a fool for all I've said

She fucking hates me

And she tore my feelings like I had none

The basis of the all-important question
Involved in the mixing and the regeneration of a person's voice
Incapable of any distinction between frequency response
Is such that the entire output is revealed in the voice
Is the actual voice itself of the voice being used
Is the voice being used?
Is the voice being used
Used voice being used
Being used voice, being voice

This type of a formation can only be explained
When two or more separate units are linked together thus forming
A screen only detectable through specially designed equipment
On released that spot type floor

Write me a letter, a face in the hall
Hiding from someone afraid of the fall
And she's waiting for someone (waiting for someone)
To take her back to where she came from
And she'll wait alone for hours (waiting all alone)
She won't mind because there's someone
In the story she remembers she remembers in the letter
And the tears locked up inside her make her heart break open wider
Shuts her eyes and takes the picture from the wall"

So long ago, I don't remember when
That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well, they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees

I seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste, she always had a pretty face
So I wondered why she hung around this place

Hey

Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We'll put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight

She said, ""It's cold, it feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade""
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed

And I seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge
Saying all there's good and nothingness is dead
We'll run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothing left
She hit the end, it's just her window ledge

Hey

Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight


Well, this place is old, it feels just like a beat-up truck
I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
What smells of cheap wine, cigarettes
This place is always such a mess
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn

I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between
The city walls of dying dreams
I think her death, it must be killing me

Hey, hey, hey

Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight"

In this little session of the promised land
Where I lounge wit my homies and I'm freakin' my friend
I gots the 6-shoota' down by my side, sittin' in the ride
Pop it in drive, I'm rolling through the Eastside
Lower, slower, down for the dip
Now hold up, check the sound flip that bitch
There's a party goin' on swingin' all night long
They come from mile around to see me freak their ________
But if a sucka' wanna trip struttin' up beat
I got a gang of hounds to make 'em pop teeth
I now this crazy-ass fool, bringin' old sasson
I got the brass for your ass
Homeboy thought you knew that...

I got homies on the south side
I know some vatos on the east side
Some my homies wanna g-ride
We're brining up the lower eastside
(repeat)

Los Delinquentes, trippin' up the place I hang
Hey, it's the guero loco wit the way I swang
See I be rollin through this _____
And my right hand man is Keemo, un delinquente con el gloc en mi hand
Es mi vida loca, I'm waistin my potential
Funky wit the lower eastside fundamentals
Lower rides, place between the 5 and the 91, north of Alondra
I was wit my su-man, my former kung-fu man
My name, Mr. Ives,( who the motha'fuck are you man?)
Well, I'mma roll this grica to let me fingers twitch
Cause the lower eastside's up in this bitch and...

I got homies on the south side
I know some vatos on the east side
West side homies wanna g-ride
We're bringin' up the lower eastside

Well let me think now
What do I wanna play
I got some homies a hop skip a jump away
Where I can always go and catch me a slug fest(what?)
Tengo familia all the way up in the midwest
Well let me come back around the grounds where I lounge
The 40-ounce booze and lounge wit my hounds
That's where the homies will be kickin' it
(hey that's the end of the 105, isn't it?)right
Shh, trucha, here comes the man
But I know these streets like the back of my hand
So while the swiney guy be lookin' around
I be flippin' a frown, as I pump my shi
Because, the cuffs won't click
The charges won't stick
I wonder when these people gonna get the fuck up off my dick
There's no way those pigs'll ever get me
Because I break putos off gently
Just a twist of the cap from the 40 in my lap
Wanna scrap we scrap
Wanna blast I'm strapped
Tell me...

Irie eyed vatos got the whole crowd jointed
Check in with Ives catch me squintin know why
I came be let my word fly keep the gleam in your eye
Con mucho drum roll on time let the horn blow
Gas to the pedal like metal at a Korn show
The rhyme rocka with a shit load of placas
Grab the mic and freak the rhythm till there's no more vavas
Still mi palabras fade all boo's and ha ha's
That includes all who go sissy la la
So do the cha cha rucca call me papa
Huero came for action hun until mañana
Down for hi-hat crash and whiplash
City nights bright lights and herb stash

Que ondas muchacho arriba las manos
Gavacho, Moreno penetra tu barrio
Lacing you with rolas that will rock back frente
RRRRRR, Blacxican esto para la gente
Like chanclaso deep like fregadaso
Still got the Coke and Rum and flex the brasos
Then I hit you from a different angle
Leg sweep cheap shot bird shit straight cop
Soy el twin pistollero guerrero don't be afraid of that
Matter of fact I got like ten thousand maniacs
In the crowd on a very good night
But keep it hype for a fraction of that to get the fery like that
Chronica en el aire todos quieren baile
Plus my sick Latin sty'le
Caile chueco as they come
I could feel the drum don't know the words, well you can hum

Oye muneca ya mueve la cadera
Sobre el ritmo y las trompetas
Feel the beat kick hard como escopeta
Vatos on the prowl for the hoochie lookin fresca
All you delincuentes vengan para en frente
Haste para atras si tu eres muy desente
Cause I'm chueco bent contact the hierba
Lo que sera sera cuando yo vuelva

Get your eyes burnt head turned
Pupils tight back stiff and your neck hurt and then you exert
Check the vibe who got more freaky than Ives
I survive, dodgin hurra tryin to shoot I
So I mueva smooth creep and crawl
Take out another batch let it thaw and lace y'all
Won't take fall this here is winner take all
Trick take a flick of the click here to face y'all"

And the world your balloon

Someone's secrets you've seen
Eyes and ears have been
Satellite dish in my yard
Tell me more, tell me more
Who's the king of your satellite castle

Winter's cold spring erases
And the calm away by the storm is chasen

And while I spend these hours
Five senses reeling
I laugh about the weatherman's satellite eyes

Oh, once upon a midnight dearie
I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said
Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies
Yeah, humor me and tell me lies
And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek, so shall we find
And when you're feeling open, I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully

But you
Why you wanna give me a runaround?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

And shake me and my confidence
'Bout a great many things
But I've been there, I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings
Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's callin' for the movie rights
Singing, ""Hey, babe, let's keep in touch
Hey, baby, let's keep in touch""
But I want more than a touch, I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky, we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line

But you
Why you wanna give me a runaround?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?


Ha-la-la-la, bombardier, this is the pilot speaking
And I've got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do

Oh, sure, the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full
Yeah, I will drink in and always be full
Oh, I like coffee and I like tea
Like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well, all right, okay, so be that way
I hope and pray that there's something left to say

But you
Why you wanna give me a runaround?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?
Oh, you
Why you wanna give me a runaround?

The sun is warm as the day is long
I just got the feeling I can do no wrong
I've got a long way to walk, can't afford my next meal
I tell a few lies but my hunger is real

And it won't mean a thing in a hundred years
No, it won't mean a thing in a hundred years

Mademoiselle tell me do you play
Well, if she shakes her head, well then that's okay
I watch her walk away in haste
There's just no accounting for some people's taste

And it won't mean a thing in a hundred years
No, it won't mean a thing in a hundred years

Big angry man in the doorway there
Just keep on walking like I don't care
Why you giving such and evil eye
Could it be you were ignored by every passerby

And it won't mean a thing in a hundred years
No, it won't mean a thing in a hundred years

Play in the park for tobacco and food
Then I excuse myself but they think I'm rude
Tourist don't want me to end his show
But this colorful attraction got places to go

And it won't mean a thing in a hundred years
No, it won't mean a thing in a hundred years

Sit at the pier watch the sun go down
Another lost little boy in a big old town
I want to laugh I want to cry
But no matter how hard I try

It won't mean a thing in a hundred years
No, it won't mean a thing in a hundred years
It won't mean a thing in a hundred years
No, it won't mean a thing in a hundred years"

Gonna raise some hell gonna raise a fuss
Cost you a dollar if you care to see
So just belly on up and tell me what'll it be
I've got a little something that I don't think you've tried
No need to run, no need to hide
Just take a little taste and tell me, what do you see
'Cause tonight we're gonna drop a little NYC
Having some fun, well, all of us are
Everyone around you's gonna be a star
'Cause it's the best and the worst, and it's life out loud
Don't mind if I preach; don't wanna get too proud
It's hard to be humble when it's all at your feet
And someday soon, it's gonna leave the street

Well you're on parole when you're on NYC

Something soon will come my way
Never failing to amaze me
I feel its wisdom anyway
Rays of sweet illumination
Inspiration too untold
I hope some day I can befriend it
I think that comes with growing old
Crystal flame
I'll do anything you say
You're my heart and my mind and my soul
At least you fill them when I play
Light so bright it hypnotizes
But it never hurts to gaze
Never to burn or char with fire
Simply the heat from warmer days
And when the moment tends to savor
When the song is close at hand
That frozen ember fills my vision
Letting the brightness take command... take command
Crystal flame
I'll do anything you say
You're my heart and my mind and my soul
At least you fill them when I play

Please, please won't you take me away
It's easy, easy just let me play
Please, please won't you take me away
It's easy, easy just let me play
Sometimes its brilliance all around me
Sometimes its light I barely see
And though I utilize its grandeur
It does not belong to me
Cause all I can do is vague description
As I do my best to share
The smooth perfection I can only dream of
The flow of all the life that's there
Life that's there
Crystal flame
I'll do anything you say
You're my heart and my mind and my soul
At least you fill them when I play
Keep me safe and never lonely
Let the rain fall where it may
And let me find the peace within me
I can find it when I play
They say that solid wet or vapor
The only forms that are portrayed
To them I ask one burning question
Of what stuff are ideas made
Are they made?

Crystal flame
I'll do anything you say
You're my heart and my mind and my soul
At least you fill them when I play
Sitting in clover looking for the fifth leaf
Something soon will come my way"

Just think about what you and I have been through
And tell me why I should not be afraid
I said don't want to hear about the promises they told us
I don't wanna hear about the progress that they made

Slow change
Don't mean nothing to me

Well fear not, cause my fear soon turns to anger
As I watch my world get ruined by a pristine hand
And I'm out here, saying Excuse me like a stranger
'Cause I never did learn how to say ""Isn't this grand""

Slow change
Don't mean nothing to me


Black cat
Squashed flat
Pretty gory

Came to play
Swept away
No big story


""We shall overcome"" is what they tell us
But the sun goes down and dawns just too many times
That's all right, don't worry, in God do we trust
Besides, you went and got yours, so I guess I'll just go get mine

Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

Now, I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

Don't touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you, though you hurt me so
Now, I'm gonna pack my things and go

""The one that makes me laugh,"" she said
Threw her arms around my neck
""Show me how you do it
And I promise you
I promise that I'll run away with you

Spinning on that dizzy edge
Kissed her face and kissed her head
Dreamed of all the different ways
I had to make her glow
""Why are you so far away?"" she said
""Why won't you ever know
That I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you?""

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream
You're just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moved my lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, just like heaven"

Monday, you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Oh, Thursday doesn't even start

And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

I don't care if Monday's black

Thursday, never looking back

Monday, you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed
Or Thursday, watch the walls instead
It's Friday, I'm in love

Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

Dressed up to the eyes, it's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throw out your frown and just smile at the sound
As sleek as a shriek, spinning round and round
Always take a big bite, it's such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough, enough of this stuff
It's Friday, I'm in love

This is the day of the expanding man
That shape is my shade
There where I used to stand
It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
At ramblers, wild gamblers
That's all in the past

You call me a fool
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real
I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
I'll make it this time
I'm ready to cross that fine line

Learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)

My back to the wall
A victim of laughing chance
This is for me
The essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love
With those of my kind
Libations, sensations
That stagger the mind

I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
I'll rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home

Learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)


This is the night of the expanding man
I take one last drag
As I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long
This brother is free
I'll be what I want to be

I'll learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)"

In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food skulls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

Soy un perdedor

Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat, for the body, for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax fallin' on a termite
Who's chokin' on the splinters

So don't let me have any rights

La, la, la-la-la
La, la, la-la-la

I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over, I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert

Oh, I know I'm being used
That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse
I know she's playing with me
That's okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem

Oh, way, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

We make plans to go out at night
I wait 'til two, then I turn out the light
This rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up, I just might tell her so

Oh, way, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care
Right? Yeah

Now I'll relate this little bit
It happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night, she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score

Oh, I know I should say no
But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem

Oh, way, oh yeah, yeah

When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends

Lump sat alone in a boggy marsh
Totally motionless except for her heart
Mud flowed up into Lump's pajamas
She totally confused all the passing piranhas

She's Lump, she's Lump
She's in my head
She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump
She might be dead

Lump lingered last in line for brains
And the one she got was sorta rotten and insane
Small things so sad that birds could land
Is Lump fast asleep or rockin' out with the band?

She's Lump, she's Lump
She's in my head
She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump
She might be dead

Oh yeah!
Ba-bow, ba-ba badadada
Ba-bow, ba-ba badadada
Ba bow, ba-ba bananana
Da-bow

Lump was limp and lonely and needed a shove
Lump slipped on a kiss and tumbled into love
She spent her twenties between the sheets
Life limped along at sub-sonic speeds

She's Lump, she's Lump
She's in my head
She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump
She might be dead
Woo!

Is this lump outta my head?
I think so
Is this lump outta my head?
I think so, yeah, woo!
Is this lump outta my head?

Steal the warm wind, tired friend

And sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep

If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

Well, you got your reasons
And you've got your lies
And you got your manipulations
They cut me down to size

Sayin' you know, but you don't
You give your love, but you won't

If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

Seems the road less traveled
Shows happiness unraveled
And you gotta take a little dirt to keep what you love
Mm, that's what you gotta do

Sayin' you know, but you don't
You give your love, but you won't
You're stretchin' out your arms to somethin' that's just not there
Sayin' you love where you stand
Give your heart when you can

If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me


You're sayin' you know, but you don't

And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape

I don't want to be your stupid game

I don't want to be the bad guy

I just want to see some palm trees

Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die

Hungry and hollow for all the things you took away
I don't want to be your good time
I don't want to be your fall-back crutch anymore

I'll walk right out into a brand new day
Insane and rising in my own weird way
I don't want to be the bad guy
I don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore

I just want to feel some sunshine
I just want to find some place to be alone

I would swallow my pride, I would choke on the rinds

Chalk white and oh-so-frail

I think sick like ginger ale

So-Cal is where my mind states
But it's not my state of mind
I'm not as ugly, sad as you
Or am I origami
Folded up and just pretend
Demented as the motives in your head

Sink when you get close, tie me to the bedpost

Make me blind when your eyes close
Tie me to the bedpost

So long ago, I don't remember when
That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well, they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees

I seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste, she always had a pretty face
So I wondered why she hung around this place

Hey

Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We'll put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight

She said, ""It's cold, it feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade""
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed

And I seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge
Saying all there's good and nothingness is dead
We'll run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothing left
She hit the end, it's just her window ledge

Hey

Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight


Well, this place is old, it feels just like a beat-up truck
I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
What smells of cheap wine, cigarettes
This place is always such a mess
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn

I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between
The city walls of dying dreams
I think her death, it must be killing me

Hey, hey, hey

Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together

Hello? (Hello, hello, hello)
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on (Come on, come on), now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb
Okay (Okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone

I have become comfortably numb"

“But there's somebody else that needs taking care of in Washington…”
“Who's that?”
“Rose Pilchitt!”
“Rose Pilchitt? Who's that?”
*child screams*
(Shut up!)
“36-24-36 *Laugh Track* does that answer your question?”
(Oi! I've got a little black book with me poems in!)
“Who's she?”
“She was 'Miss Armored Division' in 1961… ”
I've got a little black book with my poems in
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog, they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues
I've got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I've got amazing powers of observation

And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There will be nobody home

I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I've got wild staring eyes
And I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to (Fly to… fly to… fly to… fly to… fly to… fly to… fly to… fly to… fly to… fly to… fly to…)

Ooh, babe, when I pick up the phone
(“Surprise, surprise, surprise…”)
There's still nobody home

I've got a pair of Gohil's boots
And I've got fading roots"

But if you try sometimes
Well, you might find

Ahh, yeah-h-h
Oh

And I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singing, ""We're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't, we're going to blow a 50-amp fuse""
Sing it to me, honey

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
Well, you just might find
You get what you need
Ah, baby, yeah
Ahh

I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And, man, did he look pretty ill
We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was ""dead""
I said to him:

You can't always get what you want, well, no
You can't always get what you want, I tell you, baby
You can't always get what you want, no
But if you try sometime
You just might find, uh, mm
You get what you need, oh, yeah, woo!
Woo!
Ahhoww-ooh!

You get what you need
Yeah
Oww, baby
Oh, yeah

I saw her today at the reception
In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well, I could tell by her blood-stained hands
Sing it

But when she squeezed me tight, she nearly broke my spine

But when I looked in her eyes, well, I almost fell for my Lola

I walked to the door

Well, that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola

Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world
Except for Lola

Well, I'd left home just a week before
And I'd never, ever kissed a woman before
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
She said, ""Little boy, gonna make you a man""

Somewhere in the distance I hear the bells ring
Darkness settles on the town as the children start to sing
And the lady across the street she shuts out the night
There's a cast of thousands waiting as she turns out the light

Too late for love
Too late, too late, too late
Too late

London boys are gazing, girls go hand in hand
With a pocket full of innocence, their entrance is grand
And the queen of the dream stands before them all
She stretches out her hand as the curtains start to fall

But it's too late, too late, too late

And there's a lady over there, she's acting pretty cool
But when it comes to playing life, she always plays the fool

But it's too late, too late, it's too late
Too late for love
Too late, it's too late, too late
Too late

Is it all too late?
Much too late?
Can't you see it's all too late?
Yeah, it's too late

But it's too late, too late, too late
Too late for love
Too late, too late, too late
Too late
But it's too late, too late, too late
Too late for love
Too late, too late, too late

Your kind of woman gotta heart of stone
But watch it break when I get you alone
Take a chance, come lay down with me
Oh, I want to make it
Slow and steady never lost the race
Don't stop running, I'm a fool for the chase
Play the game, surrender to me
Baby, I don't want to fake it

Is it any wonder
You got me coming under fire?
Coming like thunder
You know you make me walk the wire

It's so easy to put on a show
Your body says yes but you won't let it go
But my passion it won't slip away
Oh I'm not going crazy


Under fire
You got me coming, under fire
You got me coming, under fire
Oh yeah, I'm coming, under fire

Let it go, yeah, yeah

No bed of roses, ain't no bed at all

All aboard, hahahahahaha
Ayy

Crazy, but that's how it goes
Millions of people living as foes
Maybe it's not too late
To learn how to love and forget how to hate

Mental wounds not healing
Life's a bitter shame

I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
(Let's go)

I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools
I've watched all the dropouts, who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role

Mental wounds still screaming
Driving me insane

I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words, yeah, yeah

Heirs of a cold war, that's what we've become
Inheriting troubles, I'm mentally numb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something that just isn't fair

Mental wounds not healing
Who and what's to blame?

I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle, drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrows, away tomorrows
Evil thoughts and evil doings
Cold, alone, you hang in ruins
Thought that you'd escape the reaper
You can't escape the Master Keeper

'Cause you feel life's unreal and you're living a lie
Such a shame who's to blame? And you're wondering why
Then you ask from your cask, ""Is there life after birth?""
What you saw can be Hell on this earth, Hell on this earth

Now you live inside a bottle
The reaper's traveling at full throttle
It's catching you, but you don't see
The reaper's you and the reaper is me

Breaking laws, knocking doors, but there's no one at home
Made your bed, rest your head, but you lie there and moan
Where to hide? Suicide is the only way out
Don't you know what it's really about?

Ah, now people
You really know where it's at
Ah, ah you got it, watch
Get the flaps out, Satan, Satan, Satan

Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle, drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrows
Take me away
Oh, oh, tomorrow
You never give me flaps, no flaps
No box, and no flaps, nothing"

Mr. Crowley, what went on in your head?
Oh, Mr. Crowley, did you talk to the dead?
Your lifestyle, to me, seemed so tragic
With the thrill of it all
You fooled all the people with magic
Yeah, you waited on Satan's call

Mr. Charming, did you think you were pure?
Mr. Alarming, in nocturnal rapport
Uncovering things that were sacred
Manifest on this Earth
Conceived in the eye of a secret
And they scattered the afterbirth


Mr. Crowley, won't you ride my white horse?
Mr. Crowley, it's symbolic, of course
Approaching a time that is classic
I hear that maiden's call
Approaching a time that is drastic
Standing with their backs to the wall


Was it polemically sent?
I wanna know what you meant
I wanna know, I wanna know what you meant, yeah"

Tomorrow will I find the sun or will it rain?
Everybody's having fun except me
I'm the lonely one
I live in shame

I say goodbye to romance
Goodbye to friends
I tell ya
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet, we'll meet in the end

I've been the King, I've been the clown
Now, broken wings can't hold me down
I'm free again
The jester with the broken crown
It won't be me, this time around, to love in vain

I say goodbye to romance
Goodbye to friends
I tell ya
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the end

And I feel the time is right, although I know
That you just might say to me:
""What you gonna do, what you gonna do?""
But I have to take this chance
Goodbye to friends and to romance
And to all of you
And to all of you
Come on, now


I say goodbye to romance
Goodbye to friends
I tell ya
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the end

And the weather's lookin' fine
And I think the sun will shine again
And I feel I've cleared my mind
All the past is left behind again

I say goodbye to romance
Goodbye to friends
I tell ya
Goodbye to all the past

Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save

They cursed and buried him along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone, gone
In empty burning hell, unholy one
But he's returned to prove them wrong, so wrong
Ooh, yeah, baby

Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell

It's just a sign of the times
Going forward in reverse
Still, he who laughs last
Is just a hand in the bush

So now that it's over can't we just say goodbye? (Bye, bye, goodbye)
I'd like to move on and make the most of the night
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way

Ow!
Oh, yeah, get up
Ow!
Ow, ow!

Well, they say it's kinda frightenin' how this younger generation swings
You know, it's more than just some new sensation
Well, the kid is into losin' sleep, and he don't come home for half the week
You know, it's more than just an aggravation

And the cradle will rock
Yes, the cradle will rock
And I say, ""Rock on""
Ooh, rock on

And when some local kid gets down, they try and drum him out of town
They say, ""You coulda at least faked it, boy, fake it, boy"" (ooh, stranger boy)
At an early age, he hits the street, and winds up tied with who he meets, and he's unemployed (unemployed)

Ow, and the cradle will rock, ow!
And the cradle will rock, the cradle will rock
And I say, ""Rock on""
Oh, say, ""Rock on""


Have you seen Junior's grades?
Ow!

And when some local kid gets down, they try and drum him out of town
They say, ""You coulda at least faked it, boy, faked it, boy""
And so an early age he hits the street, winds up tied with who he meets, and he's unemployed
His folks are overjoyed

And the cradle will rock
Yes, the cradle will rock
I say, ""Rock on""
Yeah, rock on

Rock on, rock on
Rock on, rock on (this ain't nothin' new, baby, child)
Ow! (Rock on)
(I said, ""Rock on"") rock on, rock on
Rock on (oh, oh, oh)
Rock on (oh, oh, oh)
Rock on (oh, oh, oh)
Rock on
Rock on"

Contact is all it takes
To change your life to lose your place in time
Contact, asleep or awake
Coming around you may wake up to find
Questions deep within your eyes
Now more than ever, you realize

And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Then simply pulls a string

Another world, some other time
You lay your sanity on the line
Familiar faces, familiar sights
Reach back, remember with all your might
Ooh, and there she stands in a silken gown
Silver lights shining down

And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
And simply pulls a string
Love comes walkin' in


Oh, sleep and dream, that's all I crave
I travel far across the Milky Way
To my master, I become a slave
'Til we meet again, some other day
Where silence speaks as loud as war
Earth returns to what it was before

And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in

And he likes his fancy clothes
And he liked to wave his diamond rings in front of everybody's nose
He got a custom Continental
He got an Eldorado too
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Well, Friday, about, a week ago
Leroy's shooting dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named Doris
And, ooh, that girl looked nice
Well, he casts his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
Leroy Brown, he learned a lesson about messing
With the wife of a jealous man

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Well, the two men took to fighting
And when they pulled them from the floor

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called ""life""
Electric word, life
It means forever, and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else:
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-All-Right
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, babe
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor)
Whoo

If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see, I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
""Ah, ah,"" is all I heard

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go
Come..

We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for? (What's it all for?)
You better live now
'Fore the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go

C'mon, baby
Let's get nuts
Yeah

Let's go crazy

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go
Go (Go crazy)

Is it him, or is it me?
Don't make me waste my time
Don't make me lose my mind, baby

Always smash the picture
Always, every time

If I told you, baby

Oh, baby, baby, baby
If we got married
Would that be cool?
You make me so confused

Or do you want me?
'Cause I want you

I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine
She said, ""How'd you like to waste some time?""
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said, ""Sign your name on the dotted line""
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind

Nikki

The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her loving will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sure enough, sure enough
Show you how to grind

Darling Nikki, oh

Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over, and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said, ""Thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you wanna grind""

Oh, Nikki, oh
Come back, Nikki, come back
Your dirty little Prince
Wants to grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind

Hello, how are you? I'm fine 'cause I know
That the Lord is coming soon, coming, coming soon"

An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat, the heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing

Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

Touch, if you will, my stomach (Hmm)
Feel how it trembles inside (Mhm)
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you, even doves have pride

And ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Was a beautiful day"

Just a small-town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlight people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlight people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night


Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on

And you knew it was gone from the very start
Do you close your eyes and dream about me
A girl in love with a gleam in her eye
I was a younger boy all dressed in white
We're older now, Do you still think about me
I remember we learned about love in the back of a chevrolet
Well it felt so good to be young, feels like yesterday
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
Do you still dream about me
I guess I don't know what I'm thinking
Coming off a hard night of drinking
Angie come closer to me, I need a soul to bleed on
It coulda been done in a different kinda way
But that ain't you, you play tough when you play
It's over now, I bet you still think about me
I remember I held you so tight
And we danced the night away
With the moves of two wide-eyed kids
I need you so much today

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
I remember we learned about love in the back of a chevrolet
No good for an old memory, to mean so much today
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I lay there in the sun
And felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep and dreamed

I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
The fact that me
An overfed, long-haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie, hmm
But there I was, mmm

I was taken to a place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon a mountaintop
Naked to the world
In front of every kind of girl
There was long ones, tall ones
Short ones, brown ones
Black ones, round ones
Big ones, crazy ones

Out of the middle
Came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy
She said

""Spill the wine, take that pearl

Spill the wine, take that pearl

I thought to myself
What could that mean?
Am I going crazy
Or is this just a dream?
Now wait a minute
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
So it's all in my head
And then
I heard her say one more time

""Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl""

I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other, a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it
She said

""Take the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Come on, come on
Spill the wine, take that pearl""

Take that pearl, yeah
It's all yours
All you've gotta do is
Spill that wine, spill that wine
Make me feel
Make me feel fine, yeah, yeah
Ow, come on
Spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine
Spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine, take that pearl
Ooh, it's all yours"

I rode my bicycle past your window last night
I roller skated to your door at daylight

Well, I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key
I think that we should get together
And try them out to see
I've been lookin' around awhile
You got somethin' for me
Oh, I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key

I ride my bike, I roller skate, don't drive no car
Don't go too fast but I go pretty far
For somebody who don't drive
I've been all around the world
Some people say I done alright for a girl

Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah

I asked your mother if you were at home
She said yes, but you weren't alone

...Congressional reports
President Ford says that he's disappointed
With Congress's performance
In Detroit, a Pontiac, Michigan youth
Was reported dead at the scene of
A head-on collision on Grand Avenue this morning
He was reportedly driving on the wrong side of the boulevard When he struck a delivery truck
And was catapulted through the windshield of his car
The driver of the truck is reported to be uninjured
The identities of both men are being withheld by local police
County legislatures today are expected to rally
To the aid of striking longshoremen
In hopes of ending the nine-month deadlock...
""..Roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day...""

I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine o'clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song, and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do
I got to

Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

Getting late, I just can't wait
Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink, then I smoke
Start the car and I try to make the midnight show

Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat


Moving fast, down 95
Hit top speed, but I'm still moving much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive
Hear my song playing on the radio, it goes

Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat


Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock
There's a truck ahead, lights staring at my eyes
Oh my God, no time to turn
I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die
Why?

Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get up!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

Rat-tailed Jimmy is a second hand hood
Deals out in Hollywood
Got a '65 Chevy, primered flames
Traded for some powdered goods
Jigsaw Jimmy, he's the one in the game
But I hear he's doin' okay
Got a cozy little job selling the Mexican mob
Packages the candy cane

He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's the one that makes ya feel all right
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood

Cops on the corner always ignore
Somebody's getting paid
Jimmy's got it wired, law's for hire
Got it made in the shade
Got a little hideaway, does business all day
But at night he'll always be found
Sellin' sugar to the sweet
People on the street
Call this Jimmy's town

He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's the one that makes ya feel all right
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's gonna be your Frankenstein

I've got one thing you'll understand

He's not what you'd call a glamorous man
(Dr. Feelgood)
Got one thing that's easily understood
(Dr. Feelgood)
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
Oh yeah

He'll tell you he's the king
Of these barrio streets
Moving up to Shangri-la
Came by his wealth as a matter of luck
Says he never broke no law
Two time loser running out of juice
Time to move out quick
Heard a rumor going 'round
Jimmy's going down
This time it's gonna stick

He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's the one that makes ya feel all right
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's gonna be your Frankenstein

Let him soothe your soul, just take his hand
(Dr. Feelgood)
Some people call him an evil man
(Dr. Feelgood)
Let him introduce himself real good

He's the only one they call Feelgood

Handful of grease in my hair feels right
But what I need to make me tight are those

Well, then she broke my heart

I tell you what, girl
Dance for me, I'll keep you over-employed
Just tell me a story

I got the photos, a menage a trois
Must've broke those Frenchies' laws with those

And then he'll have you cry for more
He'll put strength to the test
He'll put the thrill back in bed
Sure you've heard it all before
He'll be the risk in the kiss
Might be anger on your lips
Might run scared for the door

Kneel down ye sinners to streetwise religion
Greed's been crowned the new king
Hollywood dream teens, yesterday's trash queens
Save the blessings for the final ring
Amen

Take a ride on the wild side
Wild side

I carry my crucifix under my death list
Forward my mail to me in Hell
Liars and the martyrs lost faith in the Father
Long lost is the wishing well
Huh

Take a ride on the wild side
Wild side

So fast to kill
Thy Kingdom come on the wild side

Who ain't in heaven
Be Thy name on the wild side
Holy Mary
Mother, may I
Pray for us on the wild side

Name dropping no-names glamorize cocaine
Puppets with strings of gold
East LA at midnight, papa won't be home tonight
Found dead with his best friend's wife

Take a ride on the wild side

Take a ride on the wild side

Fatal strikes
We lie on the wild side
No escape
Murder, rape
Doin' time on the wild side

A cop dies
A day's pay on the wild side

But I found a way to get out of it

Sittin' in the classroom, thinkin' it's a drag
Listenin' to the teacher rap just ain't my bag
By the two bells ring, you know it's my cue
I'm gonna meet the boys on floor number two

Smokin' in the boys room

Now, teacher, don't you fill me up with your rule
'Cause everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school
Hey, hey

Checkin' out the hall, makin' sure the coast is clear
Lookin' in the stalls, nah, there ain't nobody here

To get caught would surely be the death of us all

Hey, can I be excused?


Well, put me to work in my school bookstore
Checkout counter and I got bored
Teacher was lookin' for me all around
Two hours later, you know where I was found?

Well, the times are getting hard for you, little girl
I'm a-humming and a-strumming all over God's world
You can't remember when you got your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels

You didn't know what rock and roll was
Until you met my drummer on a grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line

Now, it's the middle of the night on the open road
And the heater don't work, and it's oh, so cold
You're looking tired, you're looking kind of beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet

You didn't know how rock and roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Half-way home in the parking lot
By the look in her eye, she was giving what she got

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

Woman, you're a mess, going to die in your sleep
There's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home, you're messing around
My best friend told me you're the best lick in town

You didn't know that rock and roll burned
So, you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm, you got the speed
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

I didn't know you had a rock and roll record
Until I saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one
But look at you now, it's dark as it's dumb

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

Then I'm gone, I'm gone

Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break

Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

I'm aiming for you
I'm gonna floor you
My body's coming
All night long


The air's electric, sparking power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin

Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning"

I'll bring you the head of the demon
I'm peeling the skin from his face
The life that you lead is inhuman
Its cause and effects a disgrace

You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell

Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike (Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike

Twisted dreams that are born from delusion
The collusion of fear and torment
Decimating to stem this contusion
With a power-mad freaking intent

You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell

Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike (Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike

I'll spin the world around reeling
I have to when mankind's at stake
I might be left broken and bleeding
For it's all in the fight that we make


You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons still tolling the bell

Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike (Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike

Lightning will strike!"

Do you have the time to listen to me whine
About nothin' and everything all at once?
I am one of those melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringin' me down
I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
So quit my whinin' 'cause it's bringin' her down

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Uh-yuh-yuh-yuh
(Ooh, ooh)

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?"

A sullen riot penetrating through her mind

Scream at me until my ears bleed

All her doubts were someone else's point of view
Wakin' up this time

As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around

Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right

I see you down on the front line
Such a sight for sore eyes, you're a suicide makeover
Plastic eyes lookin' through a numbskull
Self-effaced, what's his face, you've erased yourself, so shut up
You don't let up

You have a growth that must be treated
Like a severed severe pain in the neck
You can smell it, but you can't see it
No explanation identified, 'cause

You don't know
You don't say that you got no reply

Hey you, where did you come from?
Got a head full of lead, you're an inbred bastard son
All dressed up, a red blooded A-mannequin
Do or die, no reply, don't deny that you're synthetic
You're pathetic

You have a growth that must be treated
Like a severed severe pain in the neck
You can smell it, but you can't see it
No explanation identified, 'cause

You don't say that you got no reply

Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new media
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mindfuck America
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
Well, maybe I'm the faggot America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue


Don't wanna be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's calling out to idiot America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue"

I'm the son of rage and love
The Jesus of Suburbia
The bible of ""none of the above""
On a steady diet of
Soda pop and Ritalin
No one ever died for my
Sins in Hell as far as I can tell
'Least the ones I got away with

And there's nothin' wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me

Get my television fix
Sitting on my crucifix
A living room on my private womb
While the moms and Brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes
And Mary Jane to keep me insane
Doin' someone else's cocaine

And there's nothin' wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me



At the center of the Earth in the parking lot
Of the 7-Eleven where I was taught
The motto was just a lie
It says ""home is where your heart is,"" but what a shame
'Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
It's beating out of time

City of the dead (Hey, hey)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey, hey)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey, hey)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey, hey)
No one really seems to care

I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much, but it only confirmed
That the center of the Earth is the end of the world
And I could really care less

City of the dead (Hey, hey)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey, hey)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey, hey)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey, hey)
No one really seems to care (Hey)

I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care

Everyone's so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled, but never saved
From the cradle to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the Middle East
We are the stories and disciples of
The Jesus of Suburbia

Land of make-believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make-believe (Said now it's, it's another lie)
And I don't believe

And I don't care (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
I don't care (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
I don't care, ah (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
I don't care, ah (Hoo, hoo, hoo)

Dearly beloved, are you listening?
I can't remember a word that you were sayin'
Are we demented or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

(Ooh, ooh) Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?
(Ooh, ooh) Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) For lack of a better word and that's my best excuse
Ah

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh


To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe

And I leave behind
This hurricane of fuckin' lies

I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run, I run away
To the light of masochists

And I leave behind
This hurricane of fuckin' lies
And I've walked this line
A million and one fuckin' times
But not this time


I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go
Runnin' away from pain when you've been victimized
Tales from another broken

Home
You're leavin'
You're leavin'
You're leavin'
Ah, you're leavin' home"

Hear the dogs howlin' out of key
To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery"" (Hey)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

To find the money's on the other side

Pulverize the Eiffel Towers

Bang-bang goes the broken glass, and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, settin' fire

Don't know where it goes

That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Skyscrapers, stargazers in my head

This dirty town is burnin' down in my dreams
Lost and found, city-bound in my dreams

And screamin'

Forget-me-nots, second thoughts live in isolation
Heads or tails, fairy tales in my mind

The rage and love, story of my life
The Jesus of Suburbia is a lie

Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade
Light of a silhouette, he's insubordinate
Comin' at you on the count of one, two

My name is Jimmy and you better not wear it out
Suicide commando that your mama talked about
King of the Forty Thieves and I'm here to represent
The needle in the vein of the establishment

I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal

Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe
Raised in the city in the halo of lights
Product of war and fear that we've been victimized

I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal

Are you talkin' to me?
I'll give you somethin' to cry about

In the cult of the life of crime now (St. Jimmy)
I really hate to say it, but I told you so
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down, ol' boy (St. Jimmy)
Welcome to the club and give me some blood

It's St. Jimmy and that's my name

Take away the sensation inside
Bittersweet migraine in my head
It's like a throbbin’ toothache of the mind
I can't take this feelin' anymore

Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation’s overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything'll be all right
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine

Out of body and out of mind
Kiss the demons out of my dreams
I get the funny feelin', and that's all right

I'll tell you why

Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything’ll be all right
Tell me that I won’t feel a thing
So give me Novacaine
Oh, Novacaine


Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything’ll be all right
Tell me, Jimmy, I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine

She's a rebel, she's a saint
She’s the salt of the earth, and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction

From Chicago to Toronto
She's the one that they call ol' Whatsername
She's a symbol of resistance
And she's holdin' on my heart like a hand grenade

Is she dreamin' what I'm thinkin'?
Is she the mother of all bombs? Gonna detonate
Is she trouble like I'm trouble?
Make it a double twist of fate or a melody that

She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Well, nothin' comes to mind (Hey)

An image she wants to sell
To anyone willing to buy
He steals the image in her kiss
From her heart's apocalypse
From the one called Whatsername

Nobody likes you, everyone left you
They're all out without you, having fun

Where have all the bastards gone?
The underbelly stacks up ten high
The dummy failed the crash test
Collectin' unemployment checks
A flunky only along for the ride
Where have all the riots gone
As the city's motto gets pulverized?
""What's in love is now in debt""
On your birth certificate
So strike the fuckin' match to light this fuse, 'use

The town bishop's an extortionist
And he don't even know that you exist
Stand still when it's do or die

It's not over till you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burnin', it's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late
There is nothin' left to analyze

Where will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself?
And where will we all go when it's too late?
Say
A-don't look back

You're not the Jesus of Suburbia
The St. Jimmy is a figment of
Your father's rage and your mother's love
Made me the idiot America

It's not over before it's too late
This city's burnin', it's not my burden

I am standin' all alone
Please call me only

Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live

In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no signs of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
A fixture in the city of lust

What the hell's your name?
What's your pleasure? What is your pain?
Do you dream too much?
Do you think what you need is a crutch?

In the crowd of pain
St. Jimmy comes without any shame
He says, ""We're fucked up, but we're not the same
And Mom and Dad are the ones you can blame""

Jimmy died today
He blew his brains out into the bay
In the state of mind
It's my own private suicide

Well, nobody cares, well, nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well, nobody cares, well, nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?

Jesus fillin' out paperwork now
At the facility on East 12th Street

His life's on the line with anxiety now
And she had enough, and he had plenty

Und vergiss das ganze Gelaber, jetzt mein' ich's ernst (Was?)
Ich werd' nicht aufhören, bis sie vor mir ist, wie Gott sie schuf (Yeah)
Also gib mir den Rhythmus und die Klamotten werden fliegen
Dann beug' ich dich nach vorne über und berühr' deine Zehen
Ich hab' den Jaguar stehen lassen und den Rolls-Royce genommen
Wenn sie nicht mit zu mir kommen, sollen sie eben zu Fuß gehen (Los geht's, oh!)
Was hältst du jetzt von mir
Wenn allein mein Ringfinger über 300.000 wert ist?
Lass uns trinken, ich versuch' es dir recht zu machen (Yeah)
Ludacris füllt Gläser/Körbe wie Doppel-D (Yeah)
Ich und Usher sind zurück und hinterlassen nichts als Asche
Wir wollen eine, die draußen elegant ist, aber ein Freak im Bett und schreit

Yeah, yeah
Die Süße ist tief nach unten und meinte: „Komm und fang mich“
Yeah, yeah
Ich war so perplex, ich hab' vergessen, dass sie meinte

We can fight our desires

We get ever so hot

They say we can love who we trust

Two hearts with accurate devotions
(Ooh) What are feelings without emotions?

Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

And not let go of my hand

I hang my hopes out on the line
(Ooh) Well they'd be ready for you in time
If you leave them out too long
(Ooh) They'll be withered by the sun
Full stops and exclamation marks (Ah-ah)
(Ooh) My words stumble before I start
How far can you send emotions? (Ooh-ooh)
(Ooh) Can this bridge cross the ocean?

Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking a new hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy
Yup, Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushin'
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give it to the people, spread it across the country

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Tell me go up, gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said…

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Let the night come, before the fight's won
Some might run against the test
But those that triumph embrace the fight 'cause
The fear is there to prove that courage exists
Now let the night come, before the fight's won

When I'm with you I believe
That your love is true
When we love you turn me out
You know what to do

When we touch I lose control
Now you know what's next

I've been around for a long, long year; stole many man's soul and faith
I was 'round when Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate
Pleased to meet you -- hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game
Stuck around St. Petersburg when I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers; Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank, when the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you -- hope you guess my name, oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out ""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself: I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours who get killed before they reach Bombay
Pleased to meet you -- hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah

Pleased to meet you -- hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you is just the nature of my game
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

This cowboy's runnin' from himself
And she's been livin' on the highest shelf

I saw you standing there
Sandy blonde hair, the way it came tumbling down
Just like a waterfall
And if you need a light
I'll be the match to your candle
My darling, I'm ready, to burst into flames for you

I was just coasting till we met
You remind me just how good it can get

Well I've been on fire, dreaming of you
Tell me you don't
It feels like you do
Looking like that, you'll open some wounds
How does it start?
And when does it end?
Only been here for a moment, but I know I want you
But is it too soon?
To know that I'm with you
There's nothing I can do

And sometime around one
We fell asleep to escape from the sun
And we woke up to the sound of a storm outside
We stood at your front door
You looked at me and said ""Baby, this rain changes everything""
And my heart ran away from me

I was just coasting till we met
You remind me just how good it can get

Well I've been on fire, dreaming of you
Tell me you don't
It feels like you do
Opening up can open some wounds
How does it start?
And when does it end?
Only been here for a moment, but I know I want you
Darling, I do
I'm with you

There's nothing I won't do to see you shine
I'll swing for the fences
I'll run to the line
And it's high time that you love me
'Cause you do it so well to see you shine
I'll swing for the fences
I'll run to the line

I'm so gone
Anyone could see that I'm wasted
You cut through
And I just wanna know what's in your head
Write it on a piece of paper, honey, mmm
Put it in my coat before I go
Hidden in a place you know I'll find it, oh ohh
Later when I'm sitting all alone

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new
Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defences come down, oh baby

Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now

Snow comes down
Everything is new
And different
I found you
Hidden in plain sight
Why'd I take so long?
Write it on a piece of paper, honey, mmm
Put it in my coat before I go

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new
Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?

She is something to behold
Elegant and bold

Running to my soul, oh

Calling me to come back to bed
Singing ""Georgia On My Mind""

And I

You build me up like steps
Eyes, innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like, oh

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again, I'm burning up

And I, I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth its wait
Well, now you've come and gone
I've finally worked it out, I worked it out

I never should have told you

Choose my bluest tape and unlock my car
An honest tune with a lingering lead has taken me this far
On the edge of the porch in the warm evening night
Throwing the bone for the dog I see two passing lights
Well, I wonder where that driver's bound
Is there someone, somewhere, someway out there that I've not found
A touch of smoke ain't what it seems
Dust and sunshine can also make my eyes look mean
But there's a brown cat sleeping through this day's show
Toppin' off the woodpile, breathing slow"

He lived all alone in his own little home he had a great big gallon jar
There were bottles two, one for me and you and he said, ""hey there you are""

Might take the rest of this lifetime to find the strongest fuel
But she natural, she take the moon and put it in her pocket
She's beautiful, smiling it on me while I build this rocket
Because the tongue tastes so old, can't even load you coffee sweet

She's beautiful - natural
Hanging in the diner, basking in the light, basking in the light...
She's beauty, yeah, the girl's cooking in the diner today
No, she won't show the bother, even time she gets covered in blues
I sing comical songs trying to blame myself
She's all-ready music in a booth, man, if she catch you
Hanging in the diner
Sitting in the light of Ms. Lee
Opening up early
Help a poor boy up
Open on Sunday, all day
Little sunshine rising from the park
Cross the street to the path
Keeping my teeth long and longer
And a smile...

Who held his one good eye on the queen
And there sat the king beside her
He's pointing his sword up and down with every scene
And the wizard's in the corner
Catching peanuts between his teeth
And the dogs lying in the shadow in the archway
There's one good dog sleeping filled with good ol' dog dreams
He slipped next to the wizard
Whispered something deep, to the bottom of his ear
A little joke, the one about the farmer's daughter
How she was stomping on grapes, coming up with blue feet and beer
And he slipped behind the queen
Where the fools go the rich don't mind
Lately the king's (k)nights have turned a little rusty
And his halo - I mean his crown - has gone and slipped down around his eyes
The wizard's in the corner
Pulling lizards between his knees
And the dog he been long gone
Gone to pitch for the winning team
Fifty-two, I mean fifty-four bicycles on the wall
Ready to ride, ready to ride until the last of them falls
Jack's been cooking in the kitchen
Whompin' up some biscuits for us all
For us all, For us all
Ready to ride, ready to ride, ride"

I find myself alone when each day's through

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide

7lQWRAjyhTpCWFC0jmclT4,Gangsta's Paradise,12,False,240693,Gangsta's Paradise,1995-11-07,"Coolio, L.V.","3y24n3XhZ96wgwRXjvS17T, 2LhsePRtgCo4THVKULQBL7","1 ContributorRap Critic Reviews: “Gangsta’s Paradise” by Coolio ft. L.V. LyricsHi. I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Coolio. Now, I don't think pop music history as a whole has been very kind to Coolio, since as far as I can remember, everyone's kind of taken him to be a bit of a joke, a rapper to not be taken seriously. When you talk about the biggest names in hiphop in the 90's, the names that are often tossed around are cats like Biggie Smalls, Wu-Tang, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, LL Cool J, and Nas, but I almost never hear any praise for Coolio, which is interesting, because, I mean, he wasn't a bad rapper or anything, he was decent enough, and the man had multiple hits back in the day, and in fact, the song I'm reviewing today, became the first rap song to be number 1 on the billboards year-end charts, so people knew who he was, and, I think people still know who he is, he's not some obscure reference that time forgot, I just think that, well, people don't really respect Coolio as far as Hiphop is concerned, and, hey, I get it, the guy's name is a portmanteau of ""cool"" and ""yo"", his name couldn't sound like a more cheesy ""urban"" buzzword if he called himself ""nahmean-nahmsayin"", and yeah, at the height of his fame, he did rap the theme song for a kids' t.v. show, definitely not the most gangsta thing to do in hindsight, but I'll defend that move, because, hey, Kenan and Kel was a good show, and he never struck me as someone who was trying to be a super thug or anything, But hey, honestly: it was the hair, wasn't it? Yeah, it was probably the hair. I mean, few things are gonna make you look like a comical portrayal of hip hop's aggressiveness than gravity defying braids. *I refuse to bow down to any law written by a white man, and neither will my hair!* But yeah, while I think the zero G braids were cool, it's not exactly the most toned down look you could have. I mean, if the only other rapper rocking' a similar hairstyle to you is this guy:
*show ODB with hair*
You might wanna go for something different if you want to be taken seriously. It's also not helping that, despite the fact that he's currently balding, he's decided to keep his braids up, on the two little islands of hair left on his head. Dude, cut that off, man! Go out with some dignity! *looks over* Oh, what's that? He's doing soundtracks for porn websites now? …alright… And I will say that, in addition, it's not like ""Gangsta's Paradise was the only type of music he was making. His first hit was actually this:
""Fantastic Voyage""
Yeah, a lot of his stuff was actually a lot more party oriented, but with a hardcore rap slant to it. And actually, if you think about it, his first smash hit was a song that actually serves as a transitional point for what was happening in hiphop at the time. ""Fantastic Voyage"" was released in 1994, the time period in Hiphop where rap in the mainstream charts was losing it's grip on happy dance music like C+C Music factory and Kid n Play in favor of hardcore rap like 2Pac and Bone Thugz N Harmony dominating the charts. And ""Fantastic Voyage"" represented the harder edge of that party music, but a lighter side of gangsta funk, with the bouncing bass and synth sounds commonly associated with Dr. Dre's style of harsher, thugged out rap personas, while the song, indeed incorporating themes of ghetto culture, had a main message about Coolio wishing he could close his eyes and escape the dangers of his neighborhood
Come on y'all let's take a ride
Don't you say shit just get inside
Close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it
A Place where my kids can play outside
Without living in fear of a drive-by
And ya know, where this song encapsulated the transition of trends in mainstream rap, this happier joint wasn't the one people remembered the most. The one that topped the charts and solidified Coolio into the minds of millions was the song, ""Gangsta's Paradise"". This, in my eyes, is the quintessential song that represented Hiphop's identity as a genre and at the same time, echoed the mind set of Black culture in American Society in the 90's. In fact, I'd dare say that few songs that got this popular in the 90's really summed up the overall feel of the decade, at least as far as hiphop and it's young audience was concerned
*video starts*
You know, I actually think that, in addition to this song being good, this is quite an audacious music video here, A because it's one of the very few music videos for a song on a movie's soundtrack that actually tried to incorporate what was happening in the movie clips with what was happening in the actual video (seriously, how many music videos have you watched where they just randomly throw clips or t.v. screens in there showing parts of a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with the context of the video?), and B, because it ties so well into the movie that this is from, ""Dangerous Minds"", a movie about an upper class teacher coming into a poor neighborhood to get the hardest kids to teach interested in learning. Now, I can't tell you how good the movie is at portraying this, as I haven't seen it in a while, but I don't remember it being too terrible; however, the way they tie it into the music video itself, actually having Michelle Pfeiffer in the video for a cameo, was pretty cool. And then, she says the line:
""You wanna tell me what this is all about""

Which sets off the tone in a fitting way, as here is this person of upper class privilege coming into the darker world of poverty… *ahem* visually, but uh… I guess you could say ""ethnically"" as well, and she wants to know what this is all about, what is happening in the minds of the people of this environment. And this song and video served as a microcosmic interpretation of what was happening in the black community as gangsta rap got more popular in the homes of the people typically located outsides the confines of hip hop's culture at the time… ya know… upper class white folk
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
Right of the bat, we start with Coolio interpolating a quote from Psalms, chapter 23, verse 4, and where, in the original context, the verse describes being comforted by a loving God through hardships, inciting hope and faith, Coolio contrasts that with being unassured of his life's path, saying that, now that he's gone down this road, there's no way out for him, nothing left for him to do but ride out this path of destruction until his demise, and that, in addition, no one believes in his ability to be anything more than a lowlife thug
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You betta watch how ya talkin' and where ya walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
*eyes get low* I'm gonna assume that this rhyme scheme is actually a clever way to indicate that Coolio's character had a neglectful elementary school teacher, and instead focus on the content, where he defends his motives, citing that, despite everyone on the outside wanting to portray his actions as thoughtless and unjustified, that they arise from an instinct that comes from living in an environment where survival means killing any man who poses a threat
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Now this is interesting imagery. He might be saying that he actually sees himself in the smoke, which… probably isn't likely, since smoke isn't very reflective, OR, he could be saying that he sees the smoke, the result of the fired pistol, as a part of him, he sees himself IN it, and what pistol smoke is, is an aftereffect of a violent action, which is what he embodies as what he is: an aftereffect of a violent society
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Going back to my point that this song encapsulates the 90's, we have a heavily sampled beat and chorus, which flips a Stevie Wonder song, but gives it a darker, more sinister tint

*play original*
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
You know, I really like it when a song not only uses a sample, but changes the feel of it, as Stevie Wonder's original version sounds more cerebral and contemplative, as from what I can tell from it's cryptic writing, is about people who are obsessed with the past and waste their lives reminiscing on a time that might not actually be as great as they thought it might have been, not focusing on the problems that are present in front of them, people who may be lost or insecure, and are seeking something to comfort them, similar to the psalm quoted at the beginning of Coolio's verse. Now, what do they do to flip it?
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
So here, L.V., the singer, is saying that they've been surrounded by the exact type of environment that criminals thrive off of, just as dead animals attract buzzards, the environment that they have been born into, the hood, attracts criminal activity. So, when you're born into it, why WOULDN'T you get caught up in it? It doesn't matter what type of person you throw into it, either: this environment we live in invites criminals based on the way it functions. So, as you may have guessed, the word ""paradise"" is a subversion of what the word typically represents. And whereas a lesser emcee would have used the ""paradise"" angle to blast on the fleeting perks that come with that life, like maybe the rush of drugs, easy women and power, this song focuses mainly on how this paradise is in reality festering pool of negative energy that inherently drags you down
Look at the situation, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
And I pretty much… just explained that line before it happened…
So I gotta be down with the 'hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
And in this lyric, he throws a quick jab at television's typical portrayal of life, as frequently on t.v., we see the lives of those who live 10 times better than we may ever live, and it causes us to not be content with reality, to chase after a shallow, predetermined expectation of success
Power in the money, money in the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'

A lot can be said about this guy's cadence, which has gruff but ear-catching vocal inflection, so that each line rises in it's energy and pitch, that when it gets to the end of the 4th line in the couplet, you've heard this build up of tension, leading to him saying that everyone's afraid of him, scared of who he is and what he represents, and when he says that last line, it honestly comes across as a man who doesn't know what's wrong with himself, why he is the way he is, what even motivates his actions anymore. And what really cranks this song up to what it represents is broken down in the last few lines:
They say I gotta learn
But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, foo!
This is honestly to me, one of the most important lyrics in Hiphop here. In lower class communities, our school systems keep getting their budgets gutted every year, and we have to deal with bad teachers, outdated books, and a biased educational system that doesn't care if students actually learned anything as long as they mindlessly memorize facts for tests that will never apply to their every day lives. Here, he makes it plain, in a general sense: if our own government doesn't see the value in our intelligence, and actively doesn't care about our well-being, if the ones in charge don't want to help us, and actively cut the funding for education, and has authority figures that abuse their power for their own gain at my expense, why do I need to care about what their institution wants to tell me? THAT, my friends, is what the youth of the 90's were going through in poor neighborhoods, and for the first real time in music history, you had to pay attention to the unedited words of a disenfranchised chunk of America, the people that were once glossed over are now in your face, and you had to be uncomfortable, you had to see what America's racist, classist system had done to those not lucky enough to be born in a suburban neighborhood, and FINALLY, AMERICA, YOU HAD TO LOOK YOUR PROBLEMS IN THE EYE, AND ONCE YOU DID THAT, YOU HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO… *sigh* assimilate the culture into a watered down caricature of it's former self, without really understanding it's problems, draining it of any impact, and grossly rewarded those who exploited and exaggerated the ills of it's lifestyle. Life is stupid like that…
Anyways, I give this song a 5 out of 5 stars. You know, a lot of mainstream rap songs talked about being gangsta and hardcore, but very few gave you a look into the paranoid persona, the pessimistic, self-destructive thought processes that come with it, at least very few have done it in ways that didn't come off as just trying to sound cool. I didn't feel like he enjoyed any of this. I felt like he hated this lifestyle, he hated himself, and he hated the world that put him here. This song is a lament, it is a dark evaluation of what was going on in the heart of Hiphop, and it was needed in pop culture, and… hey, this song was also parodied by Weird Al… I swear, I'm not doing this on purpose..."

Your demons come to light and your mind is not your own
Lonely is the night when there's no one left to call
You feel the time is right, say the writin's on the wall
It's a high time to fight when the walls are closin' in
Call it what you like it's time you got to win
Lonely, lonely, lonely your spirit's sinkin' down
You find you're not the only stranger in this town
Red lights, green lights, stop and go jive
Headlines, deadlines jammin' your mind
You been stealin' shots from the side
Let your feelin's go for a ride
There's danger out tonight, the man is on the prowl
Get the dynamite, the boys are set to howl
Lonely is the night when you hear the voices call
Are you ready for a fight, do you wanna take it all?
Slowdown, showdown waitin' on line
Show time, no time for changin' your mind
Streets are ringin', march to the sound
Let your secrets follow you down
Somebody's watchin' you baby, so much you can do
Nobody's stoppin' you baby, from makin' it too
One glimpse'll show you now baby, what the music can do
One kiss'll show you now baby, it can happen to you
No more sleepin', wastin' our time
Midnight creepin's, first on our minds
No more lazin' 'round the TV
You'll go crazy, come out with me
Feelin' lonely
Lonely is the night
Feelin' lonely
Lonely is the night
Lonely, lonely, lonely"

She keeps Moet et Chandon, in her pretty cabinet
""Let them eat cake,"" she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation you can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah (A killer, a killer)
Then again incidentally, if you're that way inclined (She's a killer queen)
Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less, fastidious and precise

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime


Drop of a hat, she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's all out to get you

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try? (Wanna try?)"

Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances, win or lose her
See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you, and that's the only way
Shake, shake yourself
You're every move you make
So the story goes

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a) Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
{Music Video only}
I know
I know
I know
Maybe there's another way to do this

{Music Video - Break}

Say you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only
You, lose yourself
No, not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a) Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart

After my own indecision
They confused me so
(Owner of a lonely heart)
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go
Look before you leap
(Owner of a lonely heart)
And don't you hesitate at all – no, no
Yow!

{Instrumental}

Owner of a lonely heart

(Much better than a) Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

(Much better than a) Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Sooner or later, each conclusion
Will decide the lonely heart
(Owner of a lonely heart)
It will excite, it will delight
It will give a better start
(Owner of a lonely heart)
Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
(Owner of a lonely heart)
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it
Just receive it

If you can possibly manage the time, please play both sides at one meeting
I met her on a strip
It was another lost weekend
The band was too slick
And the people were twisted
So I asked her for a date
She reluctantly agreed
Then we went to my place
And she never did leave

She won’t even miss me when she’s gone
And that’s okay with me I’ll cry later on
It’s been six months
She hasn’t shut up once
I’ve tried to explain
She’s driving me insane

She won’t even miss me when she’s gone
And that’s okay with me I’ll cry later on

Talk to ya later—don’t want to hear it again tonight
Talk to ya later—just save it for another guy
Talk to ya later—don’t want to hear it again tonight
I’ll just see you around

Get out
I’m telling you now
Do you catch my drift
What could be plainer than this
Nothin’ more to be said
Write me a letter instead
I don’t mean to be cruel
But I’m finished with you

She won’t even miss me when she’s gone
That’s okay with me I’ll cry later on

Talk to ya later—don’t want to hear it again tonight
Talk to ya later—just save it for another guy
Talk to ya later—don’t want to hear it again tonight
I’ll just see you around"

Aah!
Watch out!
You might get what you're after
Cool, babies
Strange but not a stranger
I'm an ordinary guy
Burning down the house!

Hold tight
Wait till the party's over
Hold tight
We're in for nasty weather
There has got to be a way
Burning down the house!

Here's your ticket, pack your bag
It's time for jumping overboard
The transportation is here
Close enough but not too far
Maybe you know where you are
Fighting fire with fire
Aah!

All wet
Here, you might need a raincoat
Shake-down
Dreams walking in broad daylight
Three hundred sixty-five degrees
Burning down the house!

It was once upon a place
Sometimes I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work say
""Baby, what did you expect?""
Gonna burst into flame, aah!

Burning down the house!

My house
Is out of the ordinary
That’s right
Don't wanna hurt nobody
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
Burning down the house!

No visible means of support
And you have not seen nothing yet
Everything's stuck together
And I don't know what you expect
Staring into the TV set
Fighting fire with fire, aah!"

But I'm dancing on the Valentine
I tell you somebody's fooling around
With my chances on the danger line
I'll cross that bridge when I find it
Another day to make my stand, oh woah
High time is no time for deciding
If I should find a helping hand, oh woah

Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it
Oh, why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it

The reflex is a lonely child who's waiting by the park
The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
And watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre?
And every little thing the reflex does
Leaves you answered with a question mark

I'm on a ride, and I want to get off
But they won't slow down the roundabout
I sold the Renoir and TV set
Don't wanna be around when this gets out

So why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it

When I was five, I walked the fence
While Grandpa held my hand

Weren't enough to pay the loans
Couldn't buy the seed to plant this spring
And the Farmers' Bank foreclosed
Called my old friend Schepman
Up to auction off the land
He said:
""John, it's just my job
And I hope you understand""

Hey, calling it your job, ole hoss
Sure don't make it right
But if you want me to
I'll say a prayer for your soul tonight
And grandma's on the front porch swing
With a Bible in her hand
Sometimes I hear her singing
Take me to the Promised Land
When you take away a man's dignity
He can't work his fields and cows
There'll be

Blood on the plow

Blood on the plow
There's 97 crosses
Planted in the courthouse yard
Ninety-seven families who
Lost ninety-seven farms

My neighbors and my name
And some nights
I feel like dying
Like that scarecrow in the rain

Oh!

You may drive around in your town
In a brand new shiny car
Your face in the wind and your haircut's in
Friends think you're bizarre
You may find a cushy job and I hope that you go far
But if you really want to taste some cool success
Better learn to play guitar

Play guitar, play guitar
Play guitar, oh yeah
Play guitar, play guitar
Play guitar, oh yeah

Well you got your eyes on the cheerleader queen
And you're walkin' her home from school
You know that she's only seventeen
But you know that she'll make you a fool
You know you can't touch that stuff
Without money or a brand new car
Let me give you some good advice young man
You better learn to play guitar

Play guitar, play guitar
Play guitar, oh yeah
Play guitar, play guitar
Play guitar, oh yeah

All women around the world want a phony rock star
Who plays guitar

You can pump your iron and shine your shoes
And wear your hair just right
You go down out on cruisin' street
'Cause you want to score tonight
We all want to strut our stuff
And you really want to show your scars
Forget all about that macho shit
And learn how to play guitar

Two American kids growin' up in the heartland
Jackie gon' be a football star
Diane's debutante backseat of Jackie's car

Suckin' on a chili dog outside the Tastee Freez
Diane's sittin' on Jackie's lap, he's got his hands between her knees
Jackie say, ""Hey Diane, lets run off behind a shady tree
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks, let me do what I please""

Say uh, oh, yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Say, oh, yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
They walk on

Jackie sits back, collects his thoughts for the moment
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean
""Well then, there Diane, we oughta run off to the city""
Diane says, ""Baby, you ain't missin' a thing""

But Jacky say uh, ""Oh, yeah, life goes on

Oh, yeah, they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

So let it rock, let it roll
Let the Bible Belt come and save my soul
Holdin' on to sixteen as long as you can
Changes come around real soon, make us women and men

You could feel it cos it was the month of June
How does it feel when you've got no food?

Cos the spirit of Jah, you know he leads you on
How does it feel when you've got no food?
There was a ring of dreads an' a session was there in swing

I sit alone in my four-cornered room
Starin' at candles
Oh, that shit is on?
Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth

At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls just starin' at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
Is somebody watchin' the Ak'?
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, ""Take a chill, B.""
But fuck that shit, t here's a nigga tryin' to kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every twenty seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya

I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me; it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin' ain't right
I feel I'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block?
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for 5,000 dollars?
Thought he had 'caine, but it was Gold Medal flour
Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lyin', I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with
Here they come, just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder and peepin' around corners
My mind is playin' tricks on me

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still, it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I die, then my child'll be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely
My mind is playin' tricks on me

This year, Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin'
Robbin' little kids for bags
'Til a lawman got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble, no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was goin' down, we figured
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I be seein' in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Droppin' them motherfuckin' B's on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete
Goddamn, homie
My mind is playin' tricks on me"

Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga plays his cards right
A real gangsta-ass nigga never runs his fuckin' mouth
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't start fights
And niggas always gotta high cap
Showing all his boys how he shot 'em
But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex nuts
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas know they got 'em
And everything is cool in the mind of a gangsta
'Cause gangsta-ass niggas think deep
Up three-sixty-five, ayo, 24/7
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't sleep
And all I gotta say to you, wannabe, gonna-be
Cocksucking, pussy-eating pranksters
Is when the fire dies down, what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta – heh

Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
Feeding the poor and helping out with their bills
Although I was born in Jamaica
Now I'm in the U.S. making deals
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
I mean, one that you don't really know
Riding around town in a drop-top Benz, hitting switches in my black '64
Now, gangsta-ass niggas come in all shapes and colors
Some got killed in the past
But this gangsta here was a smart one
Started living for the Lord and I'll last
Now, all I gotta say to you wannabe, gonna-be
Pussy-eating, cocksucking pranksters?
When the shit jumps off, what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta

Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga knows the play
The real gangsta-ass niggas get the flyest of the bitches
Ask that gangsta-ass nigga Lil' J
Now, bitches look at gangsta-ass niggas like a stop sign
And play the role of Little Miss Sweet
But catch the bitch all alone, get the digits, take her out
And end up hitting her ass with the meat
'Cause gangsta-ass niggas be the game-players
And everything's quiet in the clique
A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger
And his partners in the posse ain't telling off shit
Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much
All you hear is the blap from the gun blast
And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast
Now when you in the free world talkin' shit, do the shit
Hit the pen, don't let a mothafucka shank ya
But niggas like myself kick back and peep game
'Cause damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
(""And now... a word from the President:"")

Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
Getting voted in to the White House
Everything looking good to the people of the world
But the Mafia family is my boss
So every now and then I owe a favor getting down
Like letting a big drug shipment through
And send 'em to the poor community
So we can bust you-know-who
So voters of the world, keep supporting me
And I promise to take you very far
Other leaders better not upset me
Or I'll send a million troops to die at war
To all you Republicans, that helped me to win
I'd sincerely like to thank you
’Cause now I got the world swinging from my nuts
And damn, it feels good to be a gangsta"

I don't wanna run (run) no more, but I know that if I stop
I'll be another nigga headed to heaven, hanging with 'Pac
These motherfuckers look at me like I'm a slanger
Makin threats to my family, dawg I'm in danger
Who do you call when these agents want you dead
And they hit these penitentiaries and niggas make a pledge
So I dip and duck the feds, all my homies stuck out on indictments
Caught up on the phone, talking prices (Hello?)
25-to-life's the mandatory minimal
My whole community gets treated like they criminals
Prior convictions getting motherfuckers hung
Got a C.I. on the inside and everybody's sung
Mothers and fathers separated from they sons
Households are broken, you couldn't hold your tongue
If it's yours, say it's yours, take the case, do your time
When you was out here getting money from it everything was fine
Now you crying in your jail cell, stressing on the case
And the D.A. is at a nigga every other day

You in question of your manhood homey (Keep the code)

Know a nigga caught a case and he took his 25
Sat it out on appeal, and gave him back that time
A soldier in his mind and his actions said the same
Told a cracker tell your mammy suck his dick cuz he with James
Ain't no motherfucking game, we been living this for real
When the government is working, real niggas never squeal
Right here the truth revealed, Troy you a mouse
Yeah you rapping but the homey Lil Pots can't get out
Niggas they hit the pen, they get charged, then get out
On a Rule 35, he informing for the cops
You can hear it in his voice, I done listened to the tapes
Now you showing up in court, testifying for the state

Ho niggas make me hotter than tabasco
Play with my money I'ma kick you in your asshole
I see the videos, I read the magazines
Don't watch award shows, too many faggot scenes
I'm a machine, got a pistol in my loose fist
I'll leave you twisted on the ground in your boots bitch

Well this is Chuck Dawg (will you ever love another bitch?)
Fuck nah! (What's your position on a snitch homey?)
Fuck laws! (They say the Beatles was the biggest)
Nigga fuck Paul, and the rest of y'all!
I'm the little motherfucker with the big dick swangin'
Nuts still hangin', got hoes singin' the blues
Geto Boys in this bitch still bangin'
And ain't shit changin' (uh-uh) ain't shit changin'
Don't like faggots, hate politicians
Can't stand snitches, know the Feds listen
So I, send the whole world a fuck you note
Schumaker's got a desk job, fuck you ho! (Aww nah!)

I keep it real with it, to the hill with it
You gotta deal with it, cause you can still get it
And every morning when I get up I know shit don't change
I'm gettin' money out these six mo' thangs

I run circles around foes and cross 'em out like tic-tac-toe
Money money money gotta get that dough
I'm a Northside rider, pimp-slappin these biters
Fall into the club and bitches' eyes get wider
I like the way she look up in that little-bitty skirt
But 95% of this shit is brainwork
I might buy a couple of drinks, and shoot at her drawers
If she ain't talkin 'bout fuckin' I'ma get on dawg

Now gimme five or six chickens I'ma flip those birds
Cook it up in momma kitchen, let me get folks serve
If a nigga catch me slippin' I'ma get that nerd
Can't let you get away with that, that shit don't work
I wear a white t-shirt, white sneakers and hat
Somethin' cool on my wrist, a nice piece to match
Hoppin' out of somethin foreign like the beast I snatch
I don't do a lot of fashion papi, I'm just Brad
It's like that y'all (that y'all) this y'all (this y'all)
I like a skinny bitch, I like a thick broad

It's like this y'all (this y'all) that y'all (that y'all)
I like to stand and hit it from the back y'all
I ain't the cutest nigga rappin' but I still got hoes
Snatch the baddest piece up in this bitch with one eye closed
R. Kelly that's my nigga so I like girls young
18 or 23, black and white girls cum
Little Richard like the singer, Dick for short but Bill
Short mon from Jamaica, Brooklyn the real
5th Ward my second home, now I'm back to strike
Rap-A-Lot, street music, Geto Boys for life

I keep it real with it, to the hill with it
You gotta deal with it, cause you can still get it
And every morning when I get up I know shit don't change
I'm gettin' money out these six mo' thangs

C'mon

Gangsters don't dance pop, we boogie on some hard shit
Fuck the V.I.P., we buy the bar
And it's a party goin on, but we came in here to close it
Twenty niggas deep in the corner ready to roll shit
They dancin freaky, lookin sleazy as fuck
Ass bouncin everywhere, tryin to tease me with butt
But we ain't drinkin, we just chillin, we ain't sweatin these hoes
And I ain't here to answer questions, I'm just lettin you know
That if your cousin got a label or your partner can rap
Nigga cool, do your thizzle, give your partner some dap
But if you come up in this muh'fucker cappin in here
Man you ain't gon' believe what's fin' to happen in here
I'm a Southside nigga representin the good
For the North East and West side keepin it hood
Dirty wit it, I don't hesitate to put it to work
Pussy niggas on that bullshit get put in the dirt
So recognize what I be about, I'm mobbin for life
Geto Boys back together bitch, we squabbin tonight
Got the whole hood ridin cause we keepin it street
FaceMob, Chuck boogie, Willie D to the beat

We don't dance, we boogie - ride, we boogie
Ball, we boogie - shine, we boogie
So up jump the boogie, and straight hood boogie
I'm a real nigga gangsters don't dance, we boogie

Chuck Nice still in it, I ain't switchin it up
Weed smokin in the boys room, livin it up
Blue suits lookin stupid, I ain't givin a fuck
5th Ward, bloody nickel got me hittin it what
I'mma move it to the back, I wanna look at the show
See this chick I used to mash comin up through the do'
I approach her on some cool shit, I'm walkin her in
I'm in town for a minute and I'm wantin a friend
Fire up another phillie, steady feedin her lies
Eyes rollin to the back of her head, she was high
She was stupid like a snake, steady lickin her lips
{?} drugs up out the bird, so I pull out my dick
Started flashin at the party, I was drunk as a fuck
Full of weed, 'bout to conceive and twist it in public
'Til this chick walked in, said she's lovin the show
Started askin me to dance, I was tellin her noooooooo!


Walk through the do' and the DJ announce
Stop the motherfuckin music, Willie D in the house
He backed on it with my jam, that nigga was cool
He wasn't a bitch-ass ho like some of these fools
Keep the waitress on her toes, tipped her a bank
Northside niggas just love to crank
Does any one of y'all fools up in here got a gripe?
We kickin y'all motherfuckin ass tonight
Come at me sideways, I don't care if you law
I'm a dot that eye, and check that jaw
Dragged across the bar top partner
Slam you on the dance flo' and stomp the shit out ya
Somebody give me a drink to calm me down
It can be Wild Turkey, gin or Crown
I like 'em big, don't fuck with malnourished chicks
Now shake that ass you dirty bitch


Nigga! Side to side, drinkin hand, understand?
Y'all motherfuckin niggas be, backin that thang up, runnin hoppin
Whistle while you twerkin and, motherfuckin sissy-boyin
Real men bout it, you ain't even supposed to be able to move like that"

Man
Motherfuckers just follow a nigga around, dude
That's real
Some shit though, fuck these feds
Redneck, racist motherfuckers, man!

I don't wanna run (run) no more, but I know that if I stop
I'll be another nigga headed to heaven, hanging with 'Pac
These motherfuckers look at me like I'm a slanger
Makin threats to my family, dawg I'm in danger
Who do you call when these agents want you dead
And they hit these penitentiaries and niggas make a pledge
So I dip and duck the feds, all my homies stuck out on indictments
Caught up on the phone, talking prices (Hello?)
25-to-life's the mandatory minimal
My whole community gets treated like they criminals
Prior convictions getting motherfuckers hung
Got a C.I. on the inside and everybody's sung
Mothers and fathers separated from they sons
Households are broken, you couldn't hold your tongue
If it's yours, say it's yours, take the case, do your time
When you was out here getting money from it everything was fine
Now you crying in your jail cell, stressing on the case
And the D.A. is at a nigga every other day
I can see it in your face, in the middle of your soul
You in question of your manhood homey (Keep the code)

We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
We don't talk to police
We don't trust in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets we do battle in the hood
We rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood
We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
Said we don't talk to police
We ain't trustin' in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets we do battle in the hood
Yeah we rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood

See I be on some street shit, don't talk to police
I won't accept a visit from agents who wanna see
If I got shit to say about a nigga case
I'm a motherfucking nigga through and through, I ain't gay
Know a nigga caught a case and he took his 25
Sat it out on appeal, and gave him back that time
A soldier in his mind and his actions said the same
Told a cracker tell your mammy suck his dick cuz he with James
Ain't no motherfucking game, we been living this for real
When the government is working, real niggas never squeal
Right here the truth revealed, Troy you a mouse
Yeah you rapping but the homey Lil Pots can't get out
Niggas they hit the pen, they get charged, then get out
On a Rule 35, he informing for the cops
You can hear it in his voice, I done listened to the tapes
Now you showing up in court, testifying for the state

We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
We don't talk to police
We don't trust in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets, we do battle in the hood
We rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood
We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
Said we don't talk to police
We ain't trustin' in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets we do battle in the hood
Yeah we rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood

I'm knowing all the scams, all the tricks to the trade
Know a nigga trying to get clean, and you get in the way
Know a nigga tryin to get green, and you stick out the bait
Cause a nigga like a dopefiend, can't rehabilitate
Still we stickin' to the G Code, we playing by the rules
We don't fuck around with new niggas, cause new niggas is fools
We don't photograph the homies, that'll catch a nigga up
On a picture you a victim, bottom line nigga fucked
Only connect the real, staying down with the true
I got love for you Ant, you a real nigga Spook
My nigga Spoonie Gee, I can only name a few
But there's a thousand motherfuckers in the pen bulletproof
So this one here's for you, I'm a rep it 'til I die
Fuck a 5-K-1, check his P-S-I
Send his ass to the top if he say he sit at home
He a motherfucking snitch, snitching niggas need this song

We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
We don't talk to police
We don't trust in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets we do battle in the hood
We rely on these streets dawg

When it get gangsta..
When it get gangsta, yeah
When it get gangsta - will these motherfuckers ride or die
When it get gangsta, yeah
Bitch nigga you ain't no soldier, you gon' hide and cry

Well let me tell you a lil' somethin 'bout the niggas I roll with
We chin check bitches, we don't go for that ho shit
Come to the Bloody Nickel tryin to stunt
Fifty thou' say I knock yo' ass out with one punch
And I don't care how many gangsta rap songs you listen to
Or the fact you smoke weed and pack a gun, I see the bitch in you
I ain't just {?} shells, be sparkin the marks
I put a clip in you like it's a walk in the park
You can try to make bond, but I'mma stick to the script
Hit you with the pistol grip and make your L-dog flip
Youse a punk, youse a bitch, I'll say it to your face
Youse a punk youse a bitch that testified for the state
All them cowards watchin your back, just don't matter
All I gotta do is clap one and the rest gon' scatter
You click on easy targets and cats who don't bust back
Niggas thinkin y'all the real but tell me this

When it get gangsta - is your niggas gonna fight or run?
When it get gangsta, yeah
The niggas that be bumpin they be tuckin they tongue
When it get gangsta - will these motherfuckers ride or die
When it get gangsta, yeah
Bitch nigga you ain't no soldier, you gon' hide and cry

Pussies fabricated, I'm made, you hoes made up
I speak like I live it doggie, you hoes hate us
I cook and rock it cause all you hoes cake up
I'm ridin on all of you stupid hoes, pay up
What's all this wolfin niggas is barkin, come fuck with me fool
And I'mma put a hole inside yo' ass with this tool
Seven shots, niggas is gutter, we get in yo' shit
Talkin greasy like you runnin somethin, squeezin your dick
What is you itchy, what's really nigga? Call from the block
Loud talkin like you scared niggas, boy youse a mark
You know real niggas move quiet and quick to do dirt
Put this pistol up against your jersey, squeeze it and skirt
Murder be dirty {?} but that's in the plan
And here's somethin that you can't understand
How I can just up and five-finger kill me a man
This game right here for real, you niggas playin, but


Niggas always tell me how real I sound when I flow
That's cause the shit I talk about, I done done it befo'
Other rappers mouth off, that's just protection talk
I done robbed, sold dope, squeezed and left 'em in chalk
Yeah, them hard styles ain't about nuttin cocksucker
Lookin mean ain't never killed a motherfucker
So what you been to the pen and they call you a killer
I still draw this Desert E and spit at you nigga
My mind is made up, just balls and my word
Any bastard that fucked with mine gon' get scurred
Keep thinkin I'm playin, keep thinkin I'm kiddin
I'll bust yo' motherfuckin head wide open like a watermelon
Homeboy 'bout to get his ass whupped blue
And he gon' probably sue, cause that's what pussies do
Some say it ain't worth it but fuck that shit
I'd rather die like a soldier than to live like a bitch

It's the return of the murderer, maniac madman
The fully automatic M-11 in the handbag
The ending of it, the beginning of the Baghdad
Your brains blowed out, body in a trash bag
Unidentified, chalk him up a John Doe
Got most of the pieces, but they ain't found his arms though
It's far from a record, I'm different than these rap dudes
A real nigga, won't hesitate to clap fools
Ski-mask you, come up to where you lay at
Cock back, squeeze, and put 'em where your face at
The nerve of you niggas, believin' I'ma play games
You know who I'm wit, so I ain't gotta say names
{*blam*} you pussy, {*blam*} cause you a black Jew
Ain't never had love for y'all, make me clap you
And it's a done deal, don't fuck with what the truth is
And hide behind that motherfuckin' desk but when the truth's here
It's on for ya, that mean your lifeline shortens
Death to the niggas who disrespected the Jordan
I'm not a pop nigga, fuck what radio say
Fuck what video do, but this is all day
Hood nigga, I ain't gotta show you what my life like
Cause you don't persecute a motherfucker like Mike
I ain't a house nigga scum like you fools is
I was bred, born, and raised in this true shit

Funny how a nigga get caught up in all the glamour
And then they finally come to grips that this can happen
To anybody, won't discriminate who catch this
Get in the way and you a victim of a death wish
A declaration of a war and it's a warning
Follow the leader but be aware your opponent
Is in the window got guerillas where you rest at
And prepared to hit a motherfucker, bet that

Aight, let's get serious
Fuck the rap game I'm the realest nigga, period
If you ain't feelin' me you know how it goes
Jump bitch, I can't wait to kill one of you hoes
It's on if you got beef
You can be a cop, a drug dealer, or a pro athlete
Bottom line, I don't give a fuck about'cha
If I pop you in the neck, I bet some blood come out'cha
While your label only behind you greasin' his dick
Your stupid ass on a video, cheesin' and shit
J ain't shorted me a dime if he owe you bucks
The way I see you a bitch and you deserve to be fucked
Willie D is the nigga that'll bloody your clothes
Don't think you know me cause you know the hook to ""Baldhead Ho""
I light you up with a sawed off; and stab yo' ass
In the leg, in the chest, in the back and mouth

Aight nigga
Stab him in the leg, in the chest
In the back and mouth, let 'em haul him off
Give me a motherfuckin' handy shotty
And a plug of PCP, I'll kill anybody
Bust him in the ass 'til he's still
I'm Chuckwick, bitch, your Achilles heel
A short nigga quick to give a tall ass whoopin'
Got a chip on my shoulder bout the size of Brooklyn
Lookin' to start shit, I ain't scary like Scooby and Shaggy
Piss me off you better Duck like Daffy
Even if you in a rest home I'll pop ya
Even if you got a vest on I'll drop ya

Funny how a nigga get caught up in all the glamour
And then they finally come to grips that this can happen
To anybody, won't discriminate who catch this
Get in the way and you a victim of a death wish
A declaration of a war and it's a warning

Uh-huh, yeah, there it is
Yeah
Still the, truth in the game ain't a damn thing changed
Prone to tote heat up and then shoot flames
Double the O.G. of a deuce thug thang
Bitches who know me know how I do dames
Still, fuckin with James we roll in this shit hard
I locked up the South, he locked the 5th Ward
Loaded and cocked, I'm known to be a block bleeder
Known to get paper and I ain't fin' to stop neither
I got Ferraris drop Royces and shit
Ranch got horses, golf courses and shit
Eat shrimp steak crab raw oysters and shit
And still fuck around with all my boys in the bricks
International nigga, I been in and out the states
Kingston, Brazil, bitches feedin me grapes
I can, cut it and bake, all I need is some soda, a plate
A microwave, Pyrex and a cake
You can get it how you want it, what I'm spittin is free
I don't need to hold in court what I can hold in the streets
Niggas know how I was raised so ain't no question these
Consequences you gon' face when niggas fuckin with me
There it is

One for the niggas wanna cross me up
Two for the bitches wanna toss me up
Three for the people tryin to get my mail
Wanna send me to jail so they can lock me up
Four for the hoes who wanna block my shine
Five for the snitch who went and dropped that dime
Six for the suckers who ain't got no game
That's a God damn shame, that's why he hatin on mine

From the North to the South I don't need no passes
You bitches get out of line, I'mma bleed yo' asses
Look man, I ain't the huffin puffin type
I'mma put that pistol in your motherfuckin life
Mayor {​​​​​​?}​​​​​​ call my crib, I be gettin them greens
Fuckin the finest hoes that can fit in some jeans
Take an interest in politics, Chopin and Van Gogh
Shoot a motherfucker up and then go vote
They say variety is the spice of life, so we'll
Fuck the black broads and lay pipe to the whites
Puerto Ricans and Latinos, Japs and Filipinos
What is y'all trippin fo'? Pussy is pussy
I ain't gotta come where you live to shoot you in your sleep
I know niggas in yo' hood that'll do you for me
Youse a bitch-made pussy born with no nutsac
I'm a motherfuckin stand up cat, that's on the one


Spot a fine-ass bitch and I'm scoopin her up
You can sleep on me nigga if you're stupid enough
But I'll be standin in your bed receivin from your woman
You can bust in, but not while I'm cummin
Cause I'm cummin everywhere, in her hair, on her face
On her earring, even on the motherfuckin ceiling
Keep it playa with a playa, let me get my nut
After that, you can kill the bitch, I don't give a fuck
Yes indeed, Chuck smoke good weed
If it ain't hydro get the fuck out the do'

And some from my hood I'm a give one up to my hood

A blood puddle on his way to the ghetto is my rebuttal
The box cutter has his ass beggin' for mercy G
I flipped that out and gave him open heart surgury
It ain't no thang to me to kill a motherfucker

Cause they gonna bleed yes indeed

Give me your mind and I'm a open it
Name a law and I've already broken it
Cause I don't give a fuck about the system Willie Dennis
Couldn't give a fuck about the people livin' in it

But don't you flush it down the toilet bring that shit to me
And get your ass tore up from the floor up
I got some shit that'll make your motherfuckers throw up
When I attack there's no rewindin'
I hit your ass in the brain with this thang and leave you open minded

And that ain't even the half

It was 1989, my thoughts were short, my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Catching walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

While we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
""Sweet Home Alabama,"" oh, yeah
Turn it up!

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man, I'd love to see that girl again
(Man, I'd love to see that girl again) Yeah

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

Livin' my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord, I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her (Ooh-ooh)

I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows, but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waitin' on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him (Ooh)
I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him (Ooh)

I saw you yesterday with an old friend
It was the same old same, how have you been?
Since you've been gone, my world's been dark and grey
You reminded me of brighter days
I hoped you were comin' home to stay
I was headed to church
I was off to drink you away (Drink you away)
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home (Ooh-ooh)
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home

I just called to say I love you
Come back home

And it don't even matter if their veins are punctured

And all my heroes in the Methadone clinics
All you bastards at the IRS

For the shots of Jack and the caps of Meth
Half pints of love and the 5th's of stress
For the hookers all trickin' out in Hollywood
And for my hoods of the world misunderstood

And for D.B. Cooper and the money he took

Cowboy
Cowboy

Well I'm packin' up my game and I'ma head out west
Where real women come equipped with scripts and fake breasts
Find a nest in the Hills, chill like Flynt
Buy an old drop-top find a spot to pimp
And I'ma Kid Rock it up and down ya' block
With a bottle of scotch and watch lots a crotch
Buy a yacht with a flag sayin' ""Chillin' the Most""
Then rock that bitch up and down the coast
Give a toast to the sun, drink with the stars
Get thrown in the mix and tossed outta bars
Sip the Tiajuana, I want to roam
Find Motown, tell them fools to come back home
Start an escort service for all the right reasons
And set up shop at the top of Four Seasons
Kid Rock and I'm the real McCoy
And I'm headed out west sucker because I wanna be a

Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby!
West Coast chillin' with the Boone's wine
I wanna be a Cowboy, baby!
Ridein' at night 'cause I sleep all day!
Cowboy, baby!
I can smell a pig from a mile away

I bet you'll hear my whistle blowin' when my train rolls in
It goes (whistling), like dust in the wind
Stoned pimp, stoned freak, stoned out of my mind
I once was lost but now I'm just blind
Palm trees and weeds, scabbed knees and rice
Get a map to the stars, find Heidi Fleiss
And if the price is right then I'm gonna make my bid boy
And let Cali-for-ni-a know why they call me

Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby!
West Coast chillin' with the Boone's wine
I wanna be a Cowboy, baby!
Ridein' at night 'cause I sleep all day!
Cowboy, baby!
I can smell a pig from a mile away

Yeah!
Kid Rock you can call me Tex
Rollin' Sunset woman with a bottle of Beck's
Seen a slimmy in a 'Vette, rolled down my glass
And said ""Yeah this dick fits right in your ass""
No kiddin', gun slingin', spurs hittin' the floor
Call me hoss, I'm the boss with the sauce and the whores
No remorse for the sheriff, in his eye I ain't right
I'ma paint his town red, then paint his wife white
Cause chaos, rock like Amadeus
Find West Coast pussy for my Detroit playas
Mack like mayors, ball like Lakers
They told us to leave, but bet they can't make us
Why they wanna pick on me
Lock me up and snort away my key
I ain't no G, I'm just a regular failure
I ain't straight outta Compton, I'm straight out the trailer
Cuss like a sailor, drink like a mick
My only words of wisdom are just suck my dick
I'm flickin' my Bic up and down that coast and
Keep on truckin' till I fall in the ocean

Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby!
Spend all my time in Hollywood and Vine
Cowboy, baby!
Ride at night 'cause I sleep all day!
Cowboy, baby!
I can smell a pig from a mile away
Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'

Fast, on a rough road riding
High, through the mountains climbing
Twisting, turning further from my home
Young, like a new moon rising
Fierce, through the rain and lightning
Wandering out into this great unknown
And I don't want no one to cry
But, tell them if I don't survive

I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

Free, like a river raging
Strong as the wind I’m facing
Chasing dreams and racing father time
Deep like the grandest canyon
Wild like an untamed stallion
If you can’t see my heart you must be blind
You can knock me down and watch me bleed
But you can’t keep no chains on me

I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

And I'm not good at long goodbyes
But look down deep into my eyes
I was born free
Calm, facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets
Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waiting patiently for the sun to set
And when it's done, believe that I
Will yell it from that mountain high

I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

I will bow to the shining sea
And celebrate God's grace on thee"

Yeah, and I've set up and torn down this stage with my own two hands
We've traveled this land, packed tight in minivans
And all this for the fans, girls, money and fame
I play their game, and as they scream my name (my name is Kid!)
I will show no shame, I live and die for this
And if I come off soft, then chew on this!
Are you scared?

Devil without cause, and I'm back
With the beaver hats and Ben Davis slacks
30-pack of Stroh's, 30-pack of hoes
No Rogaine in the propane flows
The chosen one, I'm the living proof
With the gift of gab from the city of truth
I jabbed and stabbed and knocked critics back
And I did not stutter when I said that
I'm goin platinum (sellin' rhymes)
I went platinum (seven times)
And still they ill, and wanna see us fry
I guess because the ""Only God Knows Why"" (why)
Why (why), Why, oh

So, throw a finger in the air, let me see where you're at, say (hey, hey)

I'm giving it back, so say (hey, hey)
Show me some metal and say (hey, hey, hey, hey)

I like AC/DC and ZZ Top
Bocephus, Beasties, and the Kings of Rock
Skynyrd, Seger, Limp, Korn, the Stones
David Allan Coe and No Show Jones, yeah
Pass that bottle around
Got the rock from Detroit, soul from Motown
The underground stoned fuckin' pimp
With tracks that mack and slap back the whack
Never gay, no way, I don't play with ass
But watch me rock with Liberace flash
Punk rock, The Clash, boy bands are trash
I like Johnny Cash and Grandmaster Flash (Flash), Flash (Flash), Flash, oh

Yeah, I saw your band
Jumping around on stage like a bunch of wounded ducks, pfft
When you gonna learn, sucker?
You just can't fuck with Twisted Brown Trucker

I'm an American badass, watch me kick
You can roll with Rock or you can suck my dick
I'm a porno flick, I'm like Amazing Grace
I'm gonna fuck some hoes after I rock this place
Super fly, living double wide
Side car, my Glide, so Joe C can ride
Full sack to share, bringin' flash and flair
Got the long hair swingin', middle finger in the air
Snake skin suit, '65 Chevelle
See me ride in sin, hear the rebel yell
I won't live to tell, so if you do
Give the next generation a big ""Fuck you!""
Who knew I'd blow up like Oklahoma?
Said, ""Fuck high school,"" pissed on my diploma

I've been on the cover of the Rolling Stone
I met the President when I was half stoned
I've been so high I've gotten confused
I've been beat down broke and used, motherfucker
I drank with Hank, talked blues with Billy
Rocked with Run, sang with Shotgun Willie
Went from small time Philly to big time Bobby
From three day old chili to saké with wasabi
I'm home
Hey, I'm home

You never met a motherfucker quite like me
Not like me
Not like me
Hey, like me

No more being poured drink specials at Winners
Or being ignored by the think straight sinners
I used to smoke pinners while my moms made dinner
Now I smoke bombs and rock with Lynyrd Skynyrd
No beginners here, I'm a seasoned vet
Educated on jazz by my man Ahmet
Ertegun my friend, I've been the world and back
But I'm a Michigan boy, can you feel that?
And I'm home

You never met a motherfucker quite like me
Not like me
Goddamn, like me
Hey, like me

Never thought I'd go as far in life as this
Never made par and I could give two shits
Never wanted to sell cars 'cause my dad was a dick
Never wanted a guitar 'til I heard a lick like this
And from the depths of Dixie to my northern spots
You know it's time to rock when Old Glory drops

I pimp through town with the top let back
Black hat, fine blond
Cold Pabst in my lap, I'll adapt
To any and all situations
That's why they call me the pimp of the nation
Hey bitch
You best believe
I live in the woods, not your world of greed
Might a little weed, might a little 'ye
I'm so proud to be living in the USA

You never met a motherfucker quite like me
Hey, hey, like me
God, never met a sinner like me
Hey, hey, hey like me

You ain't never met, and you ain't never gonna meet
You never met a, never met a, never, never, never
Never met a motherfucker quite like me
You ain't never met a mother like me
Hey you ain't never, never, never, never, never met someone like me

(Hey, hey)
Never met like me
(Hey, hey, hey dude hey)
Never met a mother like me
(Come on, hey)
And you never, and you never gonna, never gonna meet

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.""

I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

Suey!

I bet there's rich folks eating from a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin' and that's what tortures me

Well if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away"

An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies, and up a cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny, and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard, and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
""If you want to save your soul from Hell, a-ridin' on our range
Then cowboy, change your ways today, or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies""

Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!

But you're in bed
Stumble out
And run dead
If it ever paid
To self-start
Environment
Make you smart
Just another victim
Just another victim
Just another victim, kid
I heard it once
But not before
Begging off
And livin' bored
My hands are tied
Webbed feet again
Fell in behind
And claim us dead
Just another victim
Just another victim, kid
Just another victim

Cast this
In spite of truth
Give it up
I'll lie to you
Blame and flame this
Turn it, start
Pointed finger
You fall apart
Just another victim
Just another victim
Just another victim
Just another victim
You played yourself
Now you're pointin' fingers
How I've robbed and raped ya
Bruised and scraped ya
But those are just lies
'Cause in your eyes
You've been victimized
It's how you size it up
You disguise it up
And try to make it look real
To cover up the low self esteem you feel

Introspection, an afterthought
Swimmin' in guilt's your favorite sport
But now you're caught up in the undertow
You never knew a man could sink so low
But now you know
'Cause you're John Doe
In a black bag
A tag on your toe
I built the house
I felt the pain
You're victimized
But got no one to blame
Just another victim
You're just another victim, kid
Just another victim
You're just another victim, kid
Holy diver, I'm a survivor
Feeling like De Niro in Taxi Driver
With Jodi Foster and Harvey Keitel
Looks like I'm walkin' through a livin' Hell
So spark that owl and I'll get lifted
Feelin' the effects of what my spliff did
'Cause I'm gifted

I read Sun Tzu
I bought a gun too, so you'll never come too
The weight of the world ridin' on my shoulders
'Cause I'm a soldier, I thought I told ya
You're just another victim
You're just another victim, kid
You're just another victim
You're just another victim, kid
You're just another victim
You're just another victim, kid
You're just another victim
You're just another victim, kid
Just another victim
Just another victim
Just another victim
Just another victim, kid"

For alla y'all, my name is Run
I rock big parties, have big fun

The glamour boys swear they are a diva
The glamour boys have it all under control
Always dancing, always laughing
The glamour boys are playing the role

The glamour boys never have no money
The glamour boys wear the most expensive clothes
The glamour boys are always at the party
Where the money comes from heaven only knows

I ain't no glamour boy (I'm fierce!)
I ain't no glamour boy (Whoo!)
I ain't no glamour boy (I'm fierce!)
I ain't no glamour boy

The glamour boys live off their ambition
The glamour boys have it all figured out
A very, very dubious position
When you got no clout

The glamour boys' whole life is a gamble
They might get over or fall flat on their face
But if one does, there's no need to worry
Another G-Boy will take his place

I ain't no glamour boy (I'm fierce!)
I ain't no glamour boy (Whoo!)
I ain't no glamour boy (I'm fierce!)
I ain't no glamour boy

The glamour boys don't think about tomorrow
The glamour boys just need tonight to play
But just like things you can't afford on credit
Time catches up and you have to pay

The glamour boys are always on the guest list
You'll always find them in the hottest spots in town
They'll be your friend if you have fame or fortune
If you don't they won't be hanging 'round

Don’t get me stirred up the smoke, through the bubbling

Down in Tijuana, Mexico
Thinkin' of the big score the night before
Met the connect who was impressively dressed in high fabrics
With troops like Beirut
Up on the mezzanine, brandishin' sub-machine guns
A-yo, it's all about the money, son
Now that's the only reason
We came south of the border to complete this work order
We gotta get it, no lookin' back, goin' all out for it
Ready to attack, die in a minute flat for it

Fuck slangin' on the corner, don't let the pigs get ya
Not like these fools who don't comprehend

But don't ever question, just do what I say and you'll be rich
And keep this in your mind — rats lay in a ditch with no spine
Don't ever forget that golden rule in the game""

Alot of a… sharks out there… try'na take a bite of somethin'. What's hot. Lot of chameleons out there… try'na change up. Anytime somethin' new comes along… everybody wants a bite. Don't happen overnight

So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid growin' up
Looking in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
The rock crowd, make money, chill with the honey's
Sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
Shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest
And the games that be comin' with it, nevertheless
You got to go for the gusto but you don't know
About the blood, sweat and tears and losing some of your peers
And losing some of yourself to the years past gone by
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act
Shit's deep, 48 tracks
Studio gangster mack signed the deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil'
But never will till he crosses over
Still filling your head with fantasies
Come with me, show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
You wanna be a rock superstar in the biz?
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
And some can't pay the way
Still trapped in what you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The route you took started collapsing
No fans, no fame, no respect, no change, no women
And everybody shits on your name

So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
Be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

People see rockstars, younawhaI'msayin? But you still… try'na… get out more like, like everybody else. You know? It's a fun job, but it's still a job, you know? Save your money man, save your money too. Hit single don't last very long, younawhaI'msayin? I mean…you're lucky in this game too. There's gon' be another cat comin' out. Lookin' like me, soundin' like me, next year I know this. They'll be a flipside, do whatchu did. Somebody'll try to spin off like some series

You ever have big dreams of makin' big cream?
Big shot, heavy hitter on the mainstream
You wanna look trendy in the Bentley
Be a snob and never act friendly
You wanna have big fame, let me explain
What happens to these stars and their big brains
First they get played like all damn day
Long as you sell everything will be okay
Then you get dissed by the media and fans
Things never stay the same way they began
I heard that some never give full to the fullest
That's why fools end up dining on a bullet
Think everything's fine in the big time
See me in my Lex' with the chrome raised high
So you wanna roll far and live large?
It ain't all that goes with bein' a rock star

So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge

Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

My own son don't know me
I'm chillin' in the hotel room lonely
But I thank God I'm with my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or video didn't show me
No love, the phony, gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like Monie
And the press say that my own people disown me
And the best way back is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
They're too worried about them honies at the Palladium
Who just wanna cling on, swing on, and so on
Go on, fall off, the hoes roll on
Till the next rock superstar with no shame
Give him a year, he'll be right out the game
The same as the last one who came before him
Gained fame, started gettin' ignored, I warned him
Assured him, this ain't easy take it from Weezy
Sleezy people wanna be so cheesy, the fuckin' lethal
""Assassins, assassins""

So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge

It's another one of them ol' funky Cypress Hill things
You know what I'm sayin?
And it goes like this

Hey don't miss out on what you're passin'
You're missin', the hoota of the funky Buddha
Eluder of your fucked up styles, I get wicked
So come on as Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaw stridin', when suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when they see me drivin'
By, hangin' out the window
With my Magnum takin' out some putos
Actin' kinda loco, I'm just another local
Kid from the street gettin' paid from my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something ya can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something ya can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something ya can't understand

I'm ignorin' all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothing is comin' from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fuckin' around
My gat straight hummin'
Hummin'... comin' at cha...
And you know I had to gat ya

Time for some action, just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shinin' a battle light
Sen got the gat, and I know that'll gat ya right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man!
One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said ""Yo, it's on
Take cover son, or you're assed-out
How you like my chrome?"" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast out, but I did anyway...
Hahaha... that young punk had to pay
(So I just killed a man!)

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite ya with insights
And if you ain't down: bullshit!
Say some punk try to get you for your auto
Would you call the one-time, play the role model?
No, I think you play like a thug
Next ya hear the shot of a Magnum slug
Hummin', comin' at cha
Yeah ya know I'm gonna gat ya
So how do ya know where I'm at, when you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm comin' from?
When you're up on the hill in your bigger home
I'm out here riskin' my dome
Just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, ay yo I gotta say ""fuck it""

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

(What does it all mean?)
All I wanted was a Pepsi
(What does it all mean?)"

Alright, stop what you're doin' 'cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to
I look funny, but yo, I'm making money, see
So, yo, world, I hope you're ready for me
Now gather 'round, I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I'll drink up all the Hennessy you got on your shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with an, ""Umpty""
Yo, ladies, oh, how I like to funk thee
And all the rappers in the top ten, please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky, I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick with this
Straight gangster mack, but sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Ayo, fat girl, come here, are you ticklish?
Yeah, I called you fat, look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy, allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly, but it just don't faze me
I'm still getting in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the Hump (Come on, uh)
Do the Humpty Hump (Come on and), do the Humpty Hump (Check me out, y'all)
Do the Humpty Hump (Just watch me), do the Humpty Hump (Yeah, do you know what I'm doing?)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Doing the Humpty Hump, come on)
Do the Humpty Hump (Ha), do the Humpty Hump

People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
That's alright 'cause I get things cookin'
You stare, you glare, you constantly try to compare me
But you can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B
All the girls, they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really being sincere
'Cause in a 69, my humpty nose will tickle your rear
My nose is big, uh-uh, I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, you know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I get stupid, I'll shoot an arrow like Cupid
I'll use a word that don't mean nothing like, ""Looptid""
I sang on, ""Doowutchyalike,"" and if you missed it
I'm the one who said, ""Just grab 'em in the biscuits""
Also told you that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
All you had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump (Come on, yeah, sexy lady)
Do the Humpty Hump (Come on, uh), do the Humpty Hump (Sexy baby, everybody)
Do the Humpty Hump (Come on and), do the Humpty Hump (Uh)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Do you know what we're doing? We're doing the Humpty Hump, y'all, uh)
Do the Humpty Hump (Watch me), do the Humpty Hump

Ah yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let a little bit of that bass groove right here
Err-rear, der-rit, err-rear, der-rit
Ah, yeah
Now that I told y'all a little bit about myself
Let me tell you a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do, check it out

First I limp to the side like my legs was broken
Shaking and twitching kind of like I was smoking
Crazy, whack, funky
People say, ""You look like MC Hammer on crack, Humpty""
That's alright 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
You got it down when you appear to be in pain
Humpin', funkin', jumpin'
Gig around, shaking your rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stunt
Tell him, ""Step off, I'm doing the Hump""

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump (Everybody, uh)
Do the Humpty Hump (Come on and), do the Humpty Hump (Sexy lady, uh)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Do you know what I'm doing? We're doing the Humpty Hump, y'all, uh, watch me)
Do the Humpty Hump (Uh), do the Humpty Hump (Yo, yo, Black people)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Come on, white people)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Puerto Ricans)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Just keep on doing the Hump, Samoans)
Do the Humpty Hump (Do the), do the Humpty Hump

Ah, yeah
Let's get stupid (Give me the music)
Uh

Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Give me— Give me the music, everybody)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Uh, give me— Give me the music)
Do the Humpty Hump (Come on and), do the Humpty Hump  (Give me— Give me the music)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Do you know what we're doing? Doing the Humpty Hump)

Ah, yeah
Go on and break it down
Uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, sexy lady
Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world
Keep on doing the Humpty Dance
And to the ladies
Peace and Humptiness forever"

Yo, Shock, man, people be comin' up to me sayin'
""Yo, man, what's up with the Underground, man?
You guys old school, new school, R&B, or hip-hop?""
What should I tell 'em?

Now, this is not your average everyday rap song
We won't be rockin' bells that go a ding and a dong
The bass drum will hit, but won't be lingering on
Check out the way we kick it on the microphone
The funky beat is playin' and we're swingin along
The Underground is rockin with the hip-hop song
The drums are ringin' with the serious tone
Ah, clock this y'all, we're on the microphone
Ah, emcees, you like the way we swing?
Well, listen close and make sure you don't miss a thing
Don't you know that we're the microphone masters?
Known to emcees as the raw-dog bastards
We bust rhymes and write everyday
So, listen close to the things that we say
Triple-slippin' emcees will get verbally raped
We'll send you home with that look on your face
And just rock this, you can't stop this
Ah, just rock this, try and clock this (Try and clock this)
The funky beat is playing and we're swingin' along
The Underground is rockin' with the hip-hop song
The funky drums is ringin' with the serious tone
Ah, clock this y'all, we're on the microphone
Ah, emcees, ya like the way we swing? (Ya like the way we swing?)
'Cause America likes the way we swing

Emcees, you like the way we swing?
I hope you do, 'cause if you don't, it don't mean a thing
See, we don't play for other hip-hop crews, it's not about you
We do the things that we wanna do
We're emcees to please the loyal followers
But you, you're just a sucker hip-hop borrower
Your real name is probably Bradworth or Bennett
Your verbal baggage ain't got nothin' in it
You think that you're rockin, but you're not hip-hoppin'
So, you best stop jockin' at the masters
Emcees, you like the way we swing? (You like the way we swing?)
Yeah, 'cause America likes the way we swing


Emcees, you like the way we swing? (You like the way we swing?)
The Queen told you that you're nothing but an underling
We're talkin' trash, we kick it kind of cocky
You can't deny it though, the drums are good and sloppy
The funky beat is playin' and we're swingin' along
The Underground is rockin' with the hip-hop song
The funky drums are ringin' with the serious tone
Ah, clock this y'all, we're on the microphone
Ah, emcees like the way we swing (They like the way we swing)
'Cause America likes the way we swing
You're triple-slippin', you're triple-slippin'
You're triple-slippin' (Yo, man), you rhyme like a school teacher
About convincing as a preacher who smokes reefer
Why don't you give it up? Just put the mic down
Get out of town with that noise, this is the Underground
Not your average everyday rap crew
You can tell by the things we say, the things that we do
The funky beat is playin' and we're swing along
Ah, clock this y'all, we're on the microphone
Ah, emcees, you like the way we swing? (Ya like the way we swing?)
'Cause America, ahh, likes the way we swing
And ya don't stop

Emcees, they don't know
Emcees, they don't know
Emcees, they don't know
Emcees, what I know
DJs, they don't know
DJs, they don't know
DJs, they don't know
DJs, what I know

You see, we have no time for suckers
Who bite with their lowers and their uppers
We came here to play and what we really wanna say is
Emcees, why don't you take the chill pill?
You really need to listen to the way we spill
Ah, these rhymes, we don't have time to drop a dime
Every time a sucker thief gets away with a line
Their mouths keep suckin' 'cause they ain't got nothin'
But they best stop fuckin' with the masters

Emcees, you like the way we swing? (You like the way we swing?)
Yeah, 'cause America, likes the way we swing
Emcees, you like the way we swing?
'Cause Africa, likes the way we swing
Emcees, you like the way we swing?
'Cause down in Australia, they love the way we swing
Emcees, you like the way we swing?
Yo, 'cause Zimbabwe likes the way we swing (And ya don't stop)
Ahh, emcees, you like the way we swing?
'Cause over in the Philippines they love the way we swing
Yeah, emcees, you like the way we swing?
Don't you know the UK, y'all, likes the way we swing?
Ahh, emcees, huh, you like the way we swing?
Even in Cleveland, they like the way we swing
Emcees, you like the way we swing?
Japan likes the way we swing
(Kick it, Shock) And ya don't stop
Ah keep on gonna rock 'til we hit the top
Ah, one time, in your mind y'all
Get busy, get busy, get busy, get busy"

S-H-I-N-I-N on the funk
And listen to the emcees rhymin' on the funk
We solemnly swear to never bust a style that's bunk
So listen to the way that we're rhyming on the funk

We really would like to ask you
Have you ever heard this style before?
You gotta say no
'Cause there ain't no denying
And if you say yes, you're lying
People are always wondering
What's up with the Underground
Are they down?
Or is just another new sound? (New sound)
We're saying things
And when we use a beat, we use it right
Because we're not just playing things
Spitting rhymes like a Tommy gun spraying things
So when you see us on stage, don't just stare us down
Or compare our sound
To any other crew ya like
Yo, judge how ya like, because we're

S-H-I-N-I-N on the funk (Shinin' on it)
And listen to the emcees rhymin' on the funk (Look, we're rhymin' on it)
We solemnly swear to never bust a style that's bunk (Never bust a bunk style)
So listen to the way we're rhyming on the funk

Riding this like a roller coaster
Hugging the curves and dipping like I'm supposed to do
For the Underground troupe
'Cause I know I'm the poop
Steaming hot, stinking up the dance floor
Gonna do it freelance for the funk
My friends and all the others in the industry
They wanna get with me (Why is that, Mon?)
Maybe it's my smooth flow
They know this guy is dope
So they get hip to the style I'm using
It's called Raw Fusion
Ain't no time for ego-tripping
Let it be known
There'll be no slipping on mine
'Cause all I want is a chunk of this Underground funk, we're

S-H-I-N-I-N on the funk (Oh, shinin' on it)
And listen to the emcees rhymin' on the funk (Rhymin' on it, yeah)
We solemnly swear (Swear) to never bust a style that's bunk (Never, never bust a bunk style)
So listen to the emcees rhyming on the funk

Yo, Money-B (What's up, cold Shock G?)
Check it out, would you tell the people what we mean?
What do you mean what we mean?
You know what I mean, tell 'em what we mean
When we're R-H-Y-M-I-N on the funk
Let 'em know that we got spunk (We got it)
And when I count to three
Go on and hit some of that humpty-hump, one, two, three
Well, I'm humpty-humping
You know that I'm saying something
The funk's in your face, gonna keep the place jumping
As the beat keeps pumping
I'm tick-tocking 'em, dope rhymes, I'm dropping 'em
On the twenty-four track and there ain't no stopping 'em (Money B)
It's too late to put the tape on pause, because we're

Rhymin' on the funk
Rhymin' on the funk
Rhymin' on the funk
Rhymin' on the funk

Tell me if you think the beat is nasty
Well, get ready, we're gonna get sweaty
Just in case, I hope you brought a towel in
I'm on the prowl when I hear the bass growling
Growling like a big bass monster
On the rampage, it's like we were on stage
Shock G speaking from the Underground
Do they understand?
I really don't give a damn, 'cause we're

Rhymin' on the funk
Rhymin' on the funk
Rhymin' on the funk

Ooh, I see guys and girls dancing, ooh, ooh

Now as the record spins around, you recognize this sound
Well, it's the Underground
You know that we're down with what you like
Yeah, with what you like, yeah
And though we're usually on the serious tip, check it out:
Tonight we're gonna flip and trip and let it all hang out tonight
We're gonna say what we like
Cause, yo, yo, we wanna know how many people in the floor
Would like to just let yourselves go
And do what you like
Yeah, well tonight's your night
 Just eat food, try not to be crude or rude
Kill the attitude, chill the serious mood
And do what you like
Yeah, and doowutchyalike
Everybody doowutchyalike


 I mean rich, poor, high, low, or upper-middle class
Let's all get together and have a few laughs
And do what we like
Yeah, and do what we like, yeah, and do what we like
And since you came here you gotta show and prove
And do that dance, until it don't move
Do what you like
Sometimes I bite
 Now if you're hungry, get yourself something to eat
And if you're dirty, then go take a bath
Messed up the line?
Nope, sometimes I don't rhyme
Help yourself to a cracker, with a spread of cheddar cheese
Have a neck bone, you don't have to say please
Eat what you like, yo, smell how you like
Everybody doowutchyalike

 Just act a fool, it's okay if you drool
Cause everybody's gonna strip, and jump in the pool
And do what we like, yeah, and do what we like
 Homegirls, for once, forget you got class
See a guy you like: just grab 'im in the biscuits!
And do what you like
 Now, red, white, black, tan, yellow, or brown
It really doesn't matter, we can all get down
And do what we like, yeah, and do what we like
From a pink-skinned Yankee, to a blue-black Southerner
Ditch digger or a governor
Just do what you like
Look how you like
 Now don't you know we're getting busy, it can't be corrected
Shake it, had to be def
I say what I like
Like I said, sometimes we bite
Even though you don't think it's right
Yo, I like to bite
Just have fun y'all, and if you think that it's wrong
You got to admit, it's a new type of song
Doowutchyalike


 Alright, here we go, y'all:
Do what you like
Talk how you like
Drink what you like
Grab who you like
Feel what you like
Eat what you like
Scratch where you like
Itch if you like

Toenails smell and look like onions
Don't doowutchyalike--
Go see a foot doctor tonight!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, everybody doowutchyalike

 Straight hair, curled, casual or glamor
 A shy girl, or loud like a bama
 From Connecticut, or from Louisiana
 Bad table etiquette, too much chatter
 Very well spoken or real bad grammar
 A minority token, a brother in the slammer
 A free civilian with a house in Santa Ana
 If you got a million and living in Atlanta
 If you got a weak bladder or can't climb a ladder
 What we're saying is, it really doesn't matter
 I need a word that sounds like ""Ana""
 Slipped on a peel of banana
Doowutchyalike
 Yeah, cold getting stupid
 Once again, you got the sound of the Underground
Baby Dope is in the house
 Boyyy!!
 Are we puttin' things in check, Baby D?
 Too stupid check
 I'm wit' it. Yo Dave, let's show 'em some old school
It makes no sense just standing around
Come on everybody, let's all...
Yeah, and do what we like
 From a lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime
Come on, young ladies, let's have 
 And do what we like
 Now I can sing, I can dance, I'm the king of romance
Are you sweet young ladies gonna give me a chance
To do what you like

Either sit or lie down, and you really should be naked
Otherwise you're gonna mess up your clothes, know what I mean?
This is more than just a dream
It's very realistic and it's gonna blow your mind
So be careful: only take one at a time
And never take one behind the wheel
You'll black out and hit a pole Cool, let's make the deal
These are 40, these are 80, and this one here is 10
Just give me a hundred dollars, I'll call it even
But don't pull your money out yet, see

Over here, Yeah, this looks kinda cool

I saw a treehouse on the outskirts of the farm
The power lines have floaters so the airplanes won't get snagged
The bells are ringing through the town again
The children look up, all they hear is sky-blue bells ringing

And the train conductor says
""Take a break, Driver 8
Driver 8, take a break
We can reach our destination
But we're still a ways away""
(But it's still a ways away)
But we're still a ways away

A way to shield the hated heat
A way to put myself to sleep

A way to put myself, my children to sleep

He piloted this song in a plane like that one
She is selling faith on the Go Tell crusade

""Take a break, Driver 8

One, two, three, four
One two-

Oh, life
Is bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost, and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this
Hint of the century
Consider this
Thе slip
That brought me to my knees
Failed
What if all thesе fantasies come flailing around?
Now I've said, too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try?
But that was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream"

When we were young, the future was so bright (Woah)

And every kid on the whole damn street (Woah)
Was gonna make it big and not be beat
Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn (Woah)
The kids are grown up, but their lives are worn (Woah)
How can one little street swallow so many lives?

Longing for what used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams

Jamie had a chance, well, she really did (Woah)
Instead, she dropped out and had a couple of kids (Woah)
Mark still lives at home 'cause he's got no job (Woah)
He just plays guitar, smokes a lot of pot
And Jay committed suicide (Woah)
And Brandon OD'd and died (Woah)
What the hell is goin' on?

Uh huh, uh huh!

Uh huh, uh huh!
And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis

You know, it's kinda hard just to get along today
Our subject isn't cool, but he fakes it anyway
He may not have a clue and he may not have style
But everything he lacks, well, he makes up in denial

So don't debate a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field and keep it real
For you, no way, for you, no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabes, ah
Hey, hey, do that brand new thing!

Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy

He needs some cool tunes, not just any will suffice
But they didn't have Ice Cube, so he bought Vanilla Ice
Now cruisin' in his Pinto, he sees homies as he pass
But if he looks twice, they're gonna kick his lily ass

So don't debate a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field and keep it real
For you, no way, for you, no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world loves wannabes, ah
Hey, hey, do that brand new thing!

Now he's gettin' a tattoo, yeah, he's gettin' ink done
He asked for a thirteen, but they drew a thirty-one
Friends say he's tryin' too hard and he's not quite hip
But in his own mind, he's the, he's the dopest trip

Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!

Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo

Debbie just hit the wall, she never had it all
One Prozac a day, husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door when she turned twenty-four
Only been with one man, what happened to her plan?

She was gonna be an actress, she was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Whitesnake's car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life, and nothing has been alright

Since Bruce Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985 (Woo-hoo-hoo)

(1985) (Woo-hoo-hoo)

She's seen all the classics, she knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, even Saint Elmo's Fire
She rocked out to Wham!, not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand on a member of Duran Duran

Where's the mini-skirt made of snake skin?
And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen?
When did reality become TV?
Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows?
On the radio was

Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985 (Woo-hoo-hoo)


She hates time, make it stop
When did Mötley Crüe become classic rock? (Classic rock)
And when did Ozzy become an actor?
Please make this stop, stop, STOP!

And bring back Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied, 1985 (Woo-hoo-hoo)
Since Bruce Springsteen (She hates time), Madonna, way before Nirvana (1985)
There was U2 (Make it stop) and Blondie, and music still on MTV (1985) (Woo-hoo-hoo)
Her two kids (She hates time) in high school, they tell her that she's uncool (1985)
'Cause she's still (Make it stop) preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985"

I walked along the avenue
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you
With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
Hypnotize me through

And I ran, I ran so far away
I couldn't get away

A cloud appears above your head
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you
The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora borealis comes in view
Aurora comes in view

And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away


Reached out a hand to touch your face
You're slowly disappearing from my view
Disappearing from my view
Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you

And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day

I got my first real six string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I shoulda known we'd never get far
But when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

There ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh yeah, back in the summer of '69
Oh

Man we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no...

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about ya'n wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
That's right!
You told me it would last forever
Oh the way you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Looking out a dirty old window
Down below, the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone, and I wonder why
Friday night, and everyone's moving
I can feel the heat, but it's soothing, heading down
I search for the beat in this dirty town

Downtown, the young ones are going
Downtown, the young ones are growing

We're the kids in America (whoa)
We're the kids in America (whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round

Bright lights, the music gets faster
Look, boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance
I'm not leaving now, honey, not a chance
Hot shot (shot), give me no problems
Much later, baby, you'll be saying, ""Never mind""
You know life is cruel, life is never kind

Kind hearts don't make a new story
Kind hearts don't grab any glory

We're the kids in America (whoa)
We're the kids in America (whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round

La, la, la, la-la, la-a
La, la, la, la-la, la (sing)
La, la, la, la-la, la-a
La, la, la, la-la, la

Come closer, honey, that's better
Got to get a brand new experience, feeling right
Oh, don't try to stop, baby, hold me tight
Outside a new day is dawning
Outside suburbia's sprawling everywhere
I don't want to go, baby

New York to East California
There's a new wave coming, I warn ya

We're the kids in America (whoa)
We're the kids in America (whoa)
Everybody lives for the music-go-round

La, la, la, la-la, la-a
La, la, la, la-la, la (sing)

Look ahead as we pass, try and focus on it

I don't know, could've been a lame jogger maybe
Or someone just about to do the freeway strangler, baby
Shopping cart pusher or maybe someone groovy
One thing's for sure, he isn't starring in the movies
Cause he's—

You only see 'em drivin' cars out on the street

Or is a roller skater in some kind of headphone disguise?

Come on, go!

Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack
I went out for a ride, and I never went back
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
I took a wrong turn, and I just kept going

Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money, and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Uh-uh-uh

I met her in a Kingstown bar
We fell in love, I knew it had to end
We took what we had, and we ripped it apart
Now here I am down in Kingstown again

Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money, and you play your part
Everybody's got a hu-hu-hungry heart

La, la, la, la-la

Everybody wants to have a home

Ain't nobody like to be alone, well

Spread out now, Rosie, doctor come cut loose her mama's reins
You know playin' blind man's bluff is a little baby's game
You pick up Little Dynamite, I'm gonna pick up Little Gun
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
You don't have to call me lieutenant, Rosie, and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft sweet little girl's tongue
Ah, Rosie, you're the one

Dynamite's in the belfry, baby, playin' with the bats
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's, tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner, waitin' for the bus
Mama, she's home in the window, waitin' up for us
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs, cause you know we ain't gonna come
Ah, I ain't here on business, baby, I'm only here for fun
And Rosie, you're the one

Rosalita, jump a little lighter
Señorita, come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover, ain't no liar
Rosalita, you're my stone desire

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie, don't you know they're gonna be there
Ah, Sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billy, they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night, it's gonna feel all right
So Rosie, come out tonight, oh, baby, come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh, closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what it's there for

Rosalita, jump a little lighter
Señorita, come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover, ain't no liar
Rosalita, you're my stone desire
All right


Now, I know your mama, she don't like me cause I play in a rock and roll band
And I know your daddy, he don't dig me, but he never did understand
Your papa lowered the boom, he locked you in your room
I'm coming to lend a hand
I'm coming to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad, your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't (have any money)
Whoa, your papa says he knows (that I don't have any money)
Whoa, so your daddy says he knows I don't have (Papa says he knows that I don't have any money)
Well, tell him this is his last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance
Because the record company, Rosie, just gave me a big advance

And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed, but the Lord had mercy
And my machine, she's a dud, I'm stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night, cause Rosie, I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light, I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way
There's a little café where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear 'em in the back room strummin'
So hold tight, baby, cause don't you know daddy's comin'
Oh, everybody, so!

Rosalita, jump a little lighter
Señorita, come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover, ain't no liar
Rosalita, you're my stone desire
Oh, yeah"

Comprende al control
Comprende al control

Pues si me buscas me encuentras, no vivo en la tienda
Ni espero a que vengas, nomás pa' que aprendas
Conmigo te topas, payaso con ropas
No estés tan tranquilo que pronto te toca
Te traigo entre ojos y los traigo rojos
El diablo anda suelto entre todos los locos
Detente y comprende lo que te conviene
A mí no me mientes, ni peles los dientes
Me comprendes, Mendes, no se por qué no entiendes
Que en este momento tú no me sorprendes
¡Harto estoy!
De que tu conciencia no te deje razón
No sabes lo que tengo yo en la mente
Es algo difícil, pues corto corriente
Ambiente, ardiente y puño en la frente
Humo que sube, ¿y no es suficiente?

¿Comprendes, Mendes?

¿Me comprendes, Mendes?
(Mendes, comprendes, yo soy el control)

Pues si te explico, aplico el por qué de este vicio
No habrá más respuestas, sólo acertijos
Yo sigo tan fijo y tú estás en el piso
Si hay que acabar algo seguro te elijo
Te traigo en la mente sólo de repente
No juegues conmigo o te trueno la frente
No pocos y locos, son muchos, ¿apoco?
Saluda al lodo, consérvalo todo
No es sencillo estar parado en la tierra
Con toda esta loquera no hay ni manera
Pa' explicar el por qué del brinco cada vez que oigo el ritmo
Que entra en la azotea y ruedas te aplico

¿Comprendes, Mendes?

(El control, el control, el control, el control)
(El control, el control, el control, el control)

El momento se presta pa' que suba la marea
La nave va pa' arriba y no tiene correa
Que detenga la bola, la sangre que brota
Ahora ponte listo que ya tienes bronca
Y no va a parar
Este maldito ritmo no me va a controlar
Estoy harto de este ruido, acabo contigo
Y no me preguntes, pues yo ya no explico
Digo que escuches al cuarto, respeta a la flor
Mírame a los ojos, verás lo que soy
Si vengo de a ratos marcando el son

Listo para volar mientras mi gente espera

Baja por las noches me arrulla yo inconsciente
En mi vientre los segundos pasados, cargados
Tatuados en mi espalda empapados aunados
A espasmos de llanto y de risa
He andado sin pausas, sin prisas
Así de lento el momento y no termina
Así de lento cruzando entre las espinas
Dime que se siente, dime que se siente
Dime que se siente el sudor en la frente
Dime que se siente, dime si presientes
Dime que se siente el sudor en la frente

El olor de mi terreno penetra en el cerebro
Se integra al sistema y toma mi cuerpo
Lo hace flotar, respirar y tranquilo
Estoy en el sitio como para ir a sembrar un poco
Y después recogerlo poco a poco
Llevarlo a mi bodega, y ver lo que me interesa
Lo bueno, lo malo...
Viene y viene el que ausenta la mantiene

Yo me temo que lo suyo es un error
Ya que yo estoy desde hace algún tiempo sin un amor
Y el último que tuve fue un dolor dentro

Usted a quien rogue pueda, hasta que no se fuera
Usted, mi grande pena, adiós, corazón, primavera
Usted que no se fuera, hasta que le rogue cuenta
Usted, mi grande pena, mi corazón sin primavera

Que anduve por ahí de bar en bar
Llorando y sin poderla olvidar
De bar en bar que anduve ahí
Llorando y sin poderla olvidar
Gastando la piel en recordar, gastando la piel en recordar

Tal vez, lo que usted cuenta sea verdad
Lamento contrariar, pero yo

No me vengas a decir que te dejé
Que la recuerde, no, no, no
Eso está olvidado en el pasado, está volado, ¿sabes?
No tengo amor y mala memoria, ¿cómo?, nah
Eso es puro suponer, quizá me confundes con alguien más, ¿cómo?
Hoy vivo mi presente, muy diferente
Tengo cosas que se han borrado de mi mente
¿Cómo quieres que viva en otro lado?
Vivo donde mismo, yo no he cambiado, no, ¿cómo?

4:20 de la madrugada, la hora adecuada
Yo no me ando con mamadas y los bajo de volada

Si te vienen a contar cositas malas de mí
Diles que sí, que yo te dije que sí fui
Si te vienen contar cositas malas de mí
Diles que sí, que yo te dije que sí fui

'Ora es el momento, demuestre que es violento
Que sí le vale verga y que trae un armamento
Que su gente lo respalda pa' las drogas y las armas
Y que aparte trae un buen adiestramiento
Que se habla con el ejército, no cierto
Que se habla con los azules, no cierto
Que se entiende con la maña, que muerde como piraña
Y si piensa que me apaña, eso no cierto
El momento, el momento es ahora
No a la hora de la hora, porque luego no le atora
Se lo digo de cora', como tú he mirado varios
Que se pintan de sicarios y resultan lo contrario
Dicen que son de barrio, que fueron pandilleros
No tienen expediente, ya chequé, son puro pedo
Pa' hacerlo verdadero, nomás se ocupa huevos
Quizá nacer de nuevo, pero no ser embustero

Si te vienen a contar cositas malas de mí
Diles que sí, que yo te dije que sí fui
Si te vienen contar cositas malas de mí
Diles que sí, que yo te dije que sí fui

No se pinte de pelón si viene del reggaetón
Justin Bieber trae tatuajes y eso no lo hace cabrón
Panochón, a ver, diga que es de a neta
Que la calle lo respeta, que su lírica es honesta
Que no es otra muñeca, como Daddy Yankee
Que llegó de jefe y al final tiró la Barbie
Diga que es un gangster, diga que es malandro
Perra, comoquiera, nadie lo baja de liandro
Actitud de chango, de todo se columpia
A todos nos menciona y a todos nos la chupa
Pambazo en la nuca al estilo de los guachos
Por acá en el norte se le llama ""chiricuazo""
Te educaré, muchacho, sin hacerte promoción
Lo que hizo en caricatura, yo lo hice después del show
Pregúntale al Snoop con quién se fumó la mota
Cállate la boca y toma lo que te toca

Si te vienen a contar cositas malas de mí
Diles que sí, que yo te dije que sí fui
Si te vienen contar cositas malas de mí
Diles que sí, que yo te dije que sí fui

Tira tu liriquilla tú solito contra mí
O si quieres todo el team, yo llegué a ponerle fin
Aquí nadie va a morir, aquí nadie va a sangrar
Es solo cuestión de rap, como Biggie con 2Pac
Risa es lo que dan, copian como cantan
Las letras se roban, como llegan se van
Ya se enteró papá quién le tiró a los fans
Y ahora por mamoncito de retache va pa' atrás
Le quiso acomodar, pero ya no le salió
El Babo ya te oyó y hasta te escribió canción
Chamaquito cachetón, es hipócrita y culón
Sé que me miro mamón, pero el güey se lo buscó

Si te vienen a contar cositas malas de mí
Diles que sí, que yo te dije que sí fui
Si te vienen contar cositas malas de mí
Diles que sí, que yo te dije que sí fui

Yo mero, el mero-mero, culero
Y cuando quiera, aquí lo espero
Y donde lo tope, pos ahí mero
Si ya sabe de qué lado me roza la trusa, homb'e
Del que me cuelga la riata
Puro pinche Cartel de Santa, a la verga, compa
Y deje la calle, a ver si es cierto to'as las pinches mama'as que canta, güey"

Que soy un adicto, que soy un violento, que soy un matón
Que tengo una vieja que deja que tenga otras viejas viviendo en el mismo cantón

No digo que soy una fiera nomás por decir que yo soy una fiera
Yo digo que soy una fiera na' más porque duermo con una pantera
Tu vieja se encuera, me manda los packs (Packs, packs, packs, packs, packs)
Le doy por atrás (-trás, -trás, -trás, -trás, -trás, -trás)
Mi jefa me dijo que era bien canijo, me dio un crucifijo mientras dijo:
""Mijo que Dios me lo cuide con su bendición"" (-ción, -ción, -ción, -ción)

Qué soy un adicto, que soy un violento, que soy un matón
Si viera tu jefa mis cuentas, me prende los blunts (Blunts, blunts, blunts)

Soy un empresario que salió del barrio
Y se hizo millonario, quemándola a diario
No acabé la prepa y estuve en prisión
Dijeron que no podía sin estudios
Y mandé a la verga sus malos augurios
Se pusieron furious cuando le hice trampa
No la levantas, pero te molesta que tengo la llave maestra
Que me abre toditas las puertas
Bebé, ten tu teta, cállate la boca
Yo tengo la rima que explota
La letra violenta, la mente siniestra que pone la muestra

Qué soy un adicto, que soy un violento, que soy un matón
Tu jefa se queja si sales conmigo, porque ando rayado como pizarrón

Pero mi trocón, se ve que le gusta
Que soy criminal, asegura la ruca
Que tengo otras putas, que traigo una fusca
'Tá loca, señora, jamás, eso nunca
Yo soy un rapero que vio a estos culeros cuando eran raperos
Yo sé quiénes fueron, por eso en su juego Don Vergas llega y los educa (Suca, fuca, fuca)
Los dejo pequeños con mi desempeño, mi acento norteño
Si quiere le enseño a moverles el cuello quemándome un leño tamaño bazuca (-zuca, fuca, fuca)

Que soy un adicto, que soy un violento, que soy un matón
Si viera tu jefa mis cuentas, me prenden los blunts (Blunts, blunts, blunts)

Oyes, no oyes lo que todos oyen cuando me oyen
Hoy es cuando, si por algo no le ando cayendo bien
Oyes, no oyes lo que todos oyen cuando me oyen
Hoy es cuando, si por algo no le ando cayendo bien

Solo me manejo, de nadie me dejo, no me hacen pendejo (-dejo, -dejo, -dejo)
Tengo unos sabuesos que atrapan conejos, yo los despellejo (-llejo, -llejo)
Pa' que mi gatita se coma la carne y los huesos, la tripa y los sesos
La pongo maciza, con pollo y conejo (-ejo, -ejo), pollo y conejo (-ejo, -ejo), pollo y conejo (-ejo, -ejo)

Que soy un adicto, que soy un violento, que soy un matón (Ah)
El trompas pensando en un muro y nosotros pensando en comprar otro dron

Pa' un peliculón, ni modo que no, quizá Jefes 2, quizá Jefes 3
Mientras dé billetes como Viernes 13, nos vamos pa' Marte también
Y cómo saber, no miro el futuro
Pero le aseguro que en nombre de Dios que nos cuida, se caen los conjuros (-juros, -juros)
Hay perros que mueren de envidia, seguro
Algunos ardillas comentan el muro (Puro culo, culo)
Me vale una hectárea de verga, lo juro
Nomás me la curo

Que soy un adicto, que soy un violento, que soy un matón (Ah)
Si viera tu jefa mis cuentas, me prenden los blunts (Blunts, blunts, blunts)

Oyes, no oyes lo que todos oyen cuando me oyen
Hoy es cuando, si por algo no le ando cayendo bien
Oyes, no oyes lo que todos oyen cuando me oyen
Hoy es cuando, si por algo no le ando cayendo bien"

Y como dice el viejón agrio
Quedate con la que te mire más a ti que a su pinche celular, compa
Wacha

Mi mujer me encontró en el celular los mensajes del WhatsApp
Ya sabe que nos vemos y que nos vamos por ahí
Que nos ponemos high, nos llenamos de placer
Ella quiere que te deje y yo no lo quiero hacer
No la quiero perder, con las dos estoy con madre
Le dije que tú sabes y que a ti te vale madres
Que es inevitable que sea mujeriego
Pero le encabrona que también te quiero
Me cachó las fotos, también los vídeos
Ni cómo negarlo, dejé abierto el Facebook
Vergüenza no tengo, pero no me alegro
Yo estaba de aquellas fumando y cogiendo
La vida viviendo, yo no lloro

¿Pa' qué me lo fumo sólo?, mejor contigo lo enrolo
Tú tan fresca, yo tan cholo, volando como el Apollo
En un viaje sideral, ¿por qué está mal? si total
Con las dos hasta el final, ella tiene que capear
Que a las dos les pertenezco, que las dos tienen su puesto
Que para ser honesto, siento que me las merezco
Ya le dije que lo nuestro es de free, sin condición
Que nos ganó la emoción
Que la única explicación que puedo darle
Ya sabe que mi sable es implacable
Tuve que contarle la verdad
Que te vi, que me gustaste para el hijo de mi apá'

Mi mujer me encontró en el celular los mensajes del WhatsApp
Ya sabe que nos vemos y que nos vamos por ahí
Que nos ponemos high, nos llenamos de placer
Ella quiere que te deje y yo no lo quiero hacer
No la quiero perder, con las dos estoy con madre
Le dije que tú sabes y que a ti te vale madres
Que es inevitable que sea mujeriego
Pero le encabrona que también te quiero
Me cachó las fotos, también los vídeos
Ni cómo negarlo, dejé abierto el Facebook
Vergüenza no tengo, pero no me alegro
Yo estaba de aquellas fumando y cogiendo
La vida viviendo, yo no lloro

Me torcieron por el 'fono antes de borrarle todo
Ya ni cómo le acomodo, ahora sí que ya ni modo
Torcido cual bandido, según yo muy precavido
Y mi vieja está enterada de que me cojo contigo
A qué moteles hemos ido, cómo y cuándo hemos cogido
Y todas las cochinadas que te digo en el oído

Porque todo lo olvido, será por pacheco
Estoy tan torcido que me dicen ""El Chueco""
Estoy tan torcido que me dicen ""El Chueco""
Todo se me olvida por andar de pacheco

Por eso no le pongo contraseña, mamá
Porque luego se me olvida, para eso es la vida
No sé pa' qué anda de ofendida, si también 'tá bien torcida
¡Wow!"

Culón, culito
Y no, tú no le atoras a un topón
En el micro porque eres copión
En el beat porque te falta flow
En la vida por ser un mamón
En la calle porque eres
Culón, culito
Y no, tú no le atoras a un topón

¿Qué hubo, que pasó? ¿No que muy felón?
¿No que muy matón como un Al Capone?
Eres un bocón, corre, correlón
Si mira al pelón se le va el valor
Ni diga que no si es bien panochón
Va a matar la verga, pero de un sentón
Pónteme mamón pa' que veas quién soy
Yo te mato el gallo a donde voy

Dejándolo en ridículo, le faltaron testículos
En la calle no hay títulos, ni reglas ni espectáculos
Culo, culo, la gente sabe que eres culo
Culo, culo, directo, yo no disimulo

Compa', conmigo se la corta
A mí el que me confronta descubre que soy mortal
Voy sobre la contra, viejas nalgas prontas
Sé que no soportan ver que no me alcanzan
Estos no la aguantan, pero ni poquito
De una cachetada se les abre el hocico
Tiran mucho pico, pero son putitos
Saludos de la verga, pinche bola de culitos

Culón, culito
Y no, tú no le atoras a un topón
En el micro porque eres copión
En el beat porque te falta flow
En la vida por ser un mamón
En la calle porque eres
Culón, culito
Y no, tú no le atoras a un topón

¿Quiubole que cua'? ¿No que muy acá?
Que eras un sica' que me iba a dar cran
Charla, charlatán, no eres de verdad
Para esto del rap yo soy el apá
No se diga más que es la realidad
Mientras yo esté vivo tú no suenas real
Pa' mí eres igualmente artificial
Que un reggaetonero haciendo rap

Pa' dejarlo en ridículo me sobraron testículos
Pa' mí no eres obstáculo, te gano hasta sonámbulo
Culo, culo, tu gente sabe que eres culo
Culo, culo, te dicen por donde deambulo

Mierda, nomás me diste cuerda
Y pa' que me detengas dudo que los tengas
No sé a qué te atengas, pero vale verga
Vengas con quien vengas, traiga lo que tenga
No te me distraigas cada vez que salgas
Pa' que no te caigas vendiendo las nalgas
Puede que te amargas, puede que te alegras
Puede que te encanta andar mamando vergas

Culón, culito
Y no, tú no le atoras a un topón
En el micro porque eres copión
En el beat porque te falta flow
En la vida por ser un mamón
En la calle porque eres
Culón, culito
Y no, tú no le atoras a un topón

Y a ver si es cierto que usted mero
Pero usted mero, no me mande ni un culero
Porque pa' pagar quien mate
Yo también traigo dinero"

Yeah
¿Dónde están, perros? Quiero verlos saltando
Denme más, perros, quiero verlos gritando
Quiero más, perros, ya los oigo ladrando
Que el Cartel trae el mando y venimos a acabarlos
¿Dónde están, perros? Quiero verlos saltando
Denme más, perros, quiero verlos gritando
Quiero más, perros, ya los oigo ladrando
Que el Cartel trae el mando y venimos a acabarlos

Soy el águila que devoró la serpiente
Poderoso como una AK-47
Piénselo dos veces antes de intentar tocar a mi gente
De donde vengo las cosas son muy diferentes
Como el jefe de jefes tengo a mis perros en la línea
Van a llorar como niñas cuando sientan mis mordidas
Aún no han hecho la tumba para el Real-Emecia-a-a-a-az
Soy el maestro, el quinto elemento
Ligero como el viento, muchos me quieren ver muerto
Pero lo siento, soy más duro que el cemento
Y en la calle recibí el mejor entrenamiento

¿Dónde están, perros? Quiero verlos saltando
Denme más, perros, quiero verlos gritando
Quiero más, perros, ya los oigo ladrando
Que el Cartel trae el mando y venimos a acabarlos
¿Dónde están, perros? Quiero verlos saltando
Denme más, perros, quiero verlos gritando
Quiero más, perros, ya los oigo ladrando
Que el Cartel trae el mando y venimos a acabarlos

Derrito los micrófonos como el plástico en el fuego
Mi voz es tan caliente que podría fundir el hierro
Nunca juego, para mí esto es cosa seria
Pero acabarlos es tan fácil como abrirle a tus hermanas las piernas
No se pierdan, que mi lengua les dará su merecido
Mientras sus novias juegan seis pulgadas debajo de mi obligo
Jodido en los bolsillos, pero rico en mi lenguaje
Mis enemigos tiemblan cuando sienten mi coraje
No se rajen, ¿para qué se echan pa'trás?
El Vikingo puso el ritmo y yo puse lo demás
Soy el zar y la calle es mi palacio
Como la mala hierba cubro todos los espacios

¿Dónde están, perros? Quiero verlos saltando
Denme más, perros, quiero verlos gritando
Quiero más, perros, ya los oigo ladrando
Que el Cartel trae el mando y venimos a acabarlos
¿Dónde están, perros? Quiero verlos saltando
Denme más, perros, quiero verlos gritando
Quiero más, perros, ya los oigo ladrando
Que el Cartel trae el mando y venimos a acabarlos

Desde Monterrey
Desde Monterrey
Desde Monterrey

Se rompieron las cadenas
Y ando buscando a mis perras
Se rompieron las cadenas
Y ando buscando a mis perras
Se rompieron las cadenas

Si te entrenas, tal vez puedas llegar a donde me encuentro
Pero advierto que soy como el tiempo, así que no me detengo
Entretengo a tu madre cuando tu padre no está
Y ahora ladren porque el Cartel acaba de llegar

¿Dónde están, perros? Quiero verlos saltando
Denme más, perros, quiero verlos gritando
Quiero más, perros, ya los oigo ladrando
Que el Cartel trae el mando y venimos a acabarlos
¿Dónde están, perros? Quiero verlos saltando
Denme más, perros, quiero verlos gritando
Quiero más, perros, ya los oigo ladrando
Que el Cartel trae el mando y venimos a acabarlos

¿Dónde están, perros?
Denme más, perros
Quiero más, perros
¿Dónde están, perros?
Denme más, perros

Ah, ah (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)

Ajá, todas mueren por mí, sí, sí, sí
Y es que es así-sí-sí, ah, ah
Todas mueren por ti (Hasta tú, perra)
Y es que es así
Ajá, todas mueren por mí, sí, sí
Y es que es así, ajá
Todas mueren por ti, ah, ah

Hímenes destrozados convertidos en abismos
Sin ser carilindo, en la cama causo sismos
Mantengo mi ritmo, les doy satisfacción
Adoro ver sus cuerpos empapados en sudor
Un extra de pasión y diversas posiciones
Han hecho que las groupies coleccionen mis condones
No te asombres, esto es real, no es ninguna fantasía
Mami, no estés triste, soy tu papi todavía
Soy tu vida, soy tu muerte y vivo para cogerte
Tengo frío el corazón, pero la verga caliente

Y es que es así
Ajá, todas mueren por mí, sí, sí
Y es que es así, sí, sí, ah, ah
Todas mueren por ti (Yo lo sé, mami)
Y es que es así
Todas mueren por mí, sí, sí
Y es que es así, sí, sí
Todas mueren por ti, ah, ah

Sí, oh (Ah-ah-ah)
Oh yeah (Ah-ah-ah)
Oh yeah (Ah-ah)

Mojarán las tangas con solo verme a los ojos
Y es que las vuelvo locas como la miel a los osos
Soy el trozo de lujuria, venenoso, soy la furia
De esos tontos envidiosos que perdieron a sus novias
En la gloria está el placer y el placer está en tu piel
Tú pagas los condones, la champaña y el hotel
Y verás que voy a hacer que te sientas en el cielo
Mami, tengo fama de para eso ser muy bueno

Y es que es así
Ajá, todas mueren por mí, ah, ah
Y es que es así-sí-sí, sí, sí
Todas mueren por ti (Hasta tú, perra)
Y es que es así
Ah, todas mueren por mí, sí, sí
Y es que es así, ah
Todas mueren por ti (Ah, ah)

Me arrojarán brasieres después de cada concierto
Y yo las haré gritar hasta dejarlas sin aliento (Ah, ah, ah)
En el sexo soy maestro y controlando el microphone
Les advierto que soy diestro y que también soy un cabrón
Luego voy a caminar directo al camerino
Su destino, si son bellas, es estar ahí conmigo
Les diré a mis amigos que se salgan enseguida
Después de unas bebidas, beberán de mi saliva
Ya imaginan lo que viene, claro, mucha diversión
Porque saben que en la cama nadie, nadie es como yo

Y es que es así
Ajá, todas mueren por mí, sí, sí, sí
Y es que es así-sí-sí, ah, ah
Todas mueren por ti (Hasta tú, mami)
Y es que es así
Ajá, todas mueren por mí, ah, ah
Y es que es así, sí, sí
Todas mueren por ti

Todas mueren, y es que es así-sí-sí, todas mueren
Esto va a ser como un dolor de muela, y es que es así-sí-sí
Te va a doler, pero no vas a querer que te la saquen, ¡jajaja!
Y es que es así-sí-sí

Te lo dice junkie, en funky
Mira, te lo meto lento si no luego te reviento las bocinas
Pura rima fina como buena metanfetamina cristalina
Con que me oigan en la esquina, la vida solo fía, nunca regala
Cualquier cosa que hagas, al chile que la pagas
Por adelantado o en abonos
Mi voz se graba en mono yo solo mantengo el tono
No sueno monótono en el micrófono
Y más gente me sigue, ¿a poco no?
Sigan inventando, tirando y difamando
Para bien o para mal, mientras de mí sigan hablando
Si los perros están ladrando
Es porque el Cartel trae el mando y seguimos cabalgando

Yo nunca miento, pero tú serás el Pinocho de mi cuento entero
A todos los que tiran mierda y lodo
Que me preocupa más lo que diga un loro
Condecoro a mis perros
Que están siempre a mi lado como en Monterrey los cerros
¿A poco no sabías que no me interesan
Las cosas que tú dices?, pa' mi son palabras huecas
Mejor no gastes tu saliva por acá
Porque todo quedará en puro blah-blah-blah

Así que sigan inventando, tirando y difamando

Aww, comin' through fo' real we Cypress Hill, ohh baby
Got that crunk, for yo' trunk, goin' gangsta crazy
We some real life hustlers, playin' games in the street
We got that low-ri-der, scrapin' dippin' on three (low-ri-der)
So pop your collar, give a holla, throw yo' dubs in the air
We tear the roof, off the mother, lady let down yo' hair
Playa do that thang, that make you feel alright (low-ri-der)
Smoke that tree, crack that brew, we gettin' freaky tonight

Now when people are done, bumpin' they head to this
You wonder why you wanted anything instead of this
We been makin' you bounce, for many years already
Rock steady and cut, many niggas to confetti
But I just want to blaze it up; whether it's the mic or a spliff
Yes my gift is to amaze you all
Thought I couldn't come for ten my friend, but guess what?
I slay niggas and still savin' my best nut (low-ri-der)
But you better cover your eyes, cause you never know when
I spit it out and start some flowin'
I drop rhymes that grow like trees you're smokin'
Ear drums feel like lungs, your brain's chokin'
Just let it soak in, seep in, creep in
I'm keepin', all you motherfuckers in the deep end (low-ri-der)
You wanna trip? Then I got luggage
I stuff you in and send you off, cause you ain't rugged

Aww, comin' through fo' real we Cypress Hill, ohh baby

We got that low-ri-der, scrapin', dippin' on three
So pop yo' collar, give a holla, throw the dubs in the air (low-ri-der)
We tear the roof, off the mother, lady let down yo' hair
Playa do that thang, that make you feel alright (low-ri-der)
Smoke that tree, crack that brew, we gettin' freaky tonight

Cause, we're Cypress Hill, come on and ride with us
Just get inside, we bouncin', dippin', chop it up real tough
Lean to the side, pimp yo' hat, tilt yo' seat on back
Don't front on me, baby boy, and break bread with the sack (low-ri-der)

I be the vato with the fine hoodrat in the ranfla
Always roll deep on the streets like the mafia
Pleito, just might come back and haunt ya
Flossin' too much, no vato's gonna want ya
Not right here homes, we're past all of that
Makin' that feria, spittin' that raps
Ya me conoces, I'm down for my calle
Cypress Ave, y el puro desmadre (low-ri-der)
Ya tu sabes, we don't play that shit
Any pendejo's gettin' hit up quick
Wassup ese? What hood you claim?
Now throw it up and down like it ain't no thang (low-ri-der)
Hands in the air with the pinky rings
Soul Assassins, runnin' everything
To all you vatos, make sure you check this
In every barrio, I'm well respected (low-ri-der)

Aww, comin' through fo' real we Cypress Hill, ohh baby

Anywhere shake smoke great and glass scrape
For the last bit of resin to make you head bake
Anywhere tigers and dragons geishas and good herb
Drum poundin make sure it soundin throughout the suburb
Anywhere there's belly dance, fans walk on they hands
In this Los Angeles puff a whole lot of canabis
Days and nights broke dreams and street fights
Every now and then catchin the flash of police lights
Anywhere they down to get faded at anytime
Anywhere there's mic , a beat and a place to rhyme
Anywhere they takin the time to feel mine
Fill mind as I'm keeping it fine like red wine
Anywhere there's low low's, valas, cholos
Cholas shakin they a** to freak photos
Anywhere the slam of the bass in like a four-four
Watch me shine making em rise just like my mojo

That's where you'll find me...
Where calles meet the sky
That's where you'll find me...
Enter your mind on most high
That's where you'll find me...
With segmented beats on time
Station Thirteen SAP mode volume above nine

Sure as porno actresses get stuffed and nailed to mattresses
I mastered my style so easily you can find me
When you burnin trees crackin open and sippin your Mickey's
Delinquencies will be there like Jack 5 to keep the party live
Bangin in your left ear drum when you at the club drag dropping
Tryin to get her to sucumb it's on and poppin
Good girls become filthy when exposed to the right herbs and devices
I'm the sound that motivates making her take it where she likes it
Thought you caught a glimpse, mentally pimps
We ain't to far from Imperial 99 get my residual
Bumpin in the trunk of locote fresh out the bote
Nocturnal creature flyin high, into the noche
Filter the bad like dream scapes deliver the goods
Rockin neighborhoods from here to ghetto France it's understood
When you look into the mirror and your reflection is clear
When you finally take a chance overcomin your fears...
You'll find me

That's where you'll find me...
Where calles meet the sky
That's where you'll find me...
Enter your mind on most high
That's where you'll find me...

Anywhere everyone love anyone for nothing
Got em huffin dancin drinkin and hand puffin
Anywhere it's a place you all might know
Anywhere a place to feel free and let it go
Find me etched into the mental of many souls young and old
Reoccuring on Station Thirteen like classic rock 'n' roll
Anywhere hefe cuts a little slack
Anywhere a place cuts skip and bounce back
Anywhere a fiesta ends in all peace
Anywhere a place all gun shots cease

Ta-ra-ra-raa

El día que naci se murió  la estrella
Llegue a este mundo, a la tierra mas bella
Es la casa de la Luna, como mi patria
En este mundo solo hay una, es la tierra del sol
Mi gente tiene estilo y esta llena de sabor
Soy fuerte como el Tequila (ahh)
Tambien soy bravo como el Licor
Verde, blanco y rojo
Ese es mi color
No tengo dinero pero me sobra el valor
Por mucho que se encuentre siempre traigo el calor
No olvido mi raiz, soy hijo del maiz
Orgulloso yo me siento de este gran pais
Soy pariente de Villa tambien de Zapata
Destapate un Tecate despues una Modelo
Ya estuvo chido compa
Con esta me consuelo

(Hook)

No encuentro por donde comenzar
Tantas cosas que tenemos, nunca voy a terminar
Aquellos malinchistas yo los voy a fusilar
Soy Azteca, Chichimeca, Zapoteca (y adentro)
Indio, Yaqui, Tarasco y Maya
Libra por libra somos los mejores
Kilo por kilo somos los campeones
Me gusta el pulque a todo el tamal
Me gustan las tortillas recien hechas en comal
Chingon pa' todo, soy profesional
Sobrevivo donde quiera
Siempre encuentro la manera
En todos los lugares
Yo levanto mi bandera
Somos tales, nos gustan los nopales
Le hacemos a todo cualquier tipo de jale
Chale no tiene chanza
El nombre de México tatuado en mi panza


Vivo y directo de la Sierra Morada
Poniendo Tepechitlan pa' tras en el mapa
Libra'o de mi jaula, el sol en mi cara
Pulsando en mis venas
Es el orgullo en mi corazón
El mismo que oyen en mi voz
El mismo que no se conquisto
El mismo que viajo a'na tierra extranjera
Nunca olvidando a mi cultura
Regrese (Con mi gente)
Para dar mi respeto
Y esta la dedico a mis paisanos
Cultivando la tierra, plantando la siembra
Y despues de la temporada disfrutando la cosecha
(Somos) Pobres pero honrados
Lo claro es lo descente
México bello y amado si muero fuera de ti
Que digan que estoy durmiendo
Y que me traigan a ti

¿Qué hubo? Aquí estoy, MC Kid Frost
Yo soy jefe, patron, yes, the big boss
My cuete's loaded, it's full of balas
I put it in your face and you won't say nada
Vatos, cholos, you call us what you will
You say we are assassins an we are sent to kill
It's in my blood to be an Aztec Warrior
Go to any extreme and hold no barriers
Chicano and I'm Brown and I'm proud
Guantes, chingaso, simón, ese let’s get down
Right now, in the dirt
What's the matter? You afraid you're gonna get hurt?
I'm with my homeboys, my camaradas
Kicking' back con mi ganga y para mi no vale nada
Yo soy chingon ese, like Al Capone ese
Controlo a todos solo never try to sweat me
Some of you don't know what's happening, ¿que pasa?
It's not for you anyway, cause this is for the Raza

This is for La Raza
Raza, Raza, Raza...
This is for La Raza

The foreign tongue I’m speaking is known as Calo
Y sabes que loco, yo soy muy malo
Tu no sabes nada, your brains is hallow
Been hit in the head too many times with a palo
Still you trying to act cool, but you should know
You're so cool that I'mma call you a culo
You’re just a pee-wee, you can’t get none ever
You're on the leva
Your own barrio doesn't back you up
They just look at your ass and call you a poo butt
And so I look and I laugh and say que pasa
Yeah, this is for the Raza

Raza, Raza, Raza...


Cruising in the calle, headed for the bolo
No want to go with me, so I had to go solo
And when I go out alone, I'm packed
I don’t sweat the chavalas when I know that I’m strapped
Every time that I pack my piece
I pull it out quick, all the nonsense will cease
Just like the song when you're 18 With A Bullet
Got my finger on a trigger, I'm not afraid to pull it
If it gets out of hand, I know some mafiosos
Who can pull out cuetes on some stupid ass babosos
Sitting there wondering what's happened, que pasa
Yeah, this is for the Raza

This is for La Raza
Raza, Raza, Raza...
This is for La Raza"

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she living, she golden
She lives for me, says she lives for the ovation
Her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I'll make you smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give 'em the games she play, she say

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

The sky was gold, it was rose, I was taking sips of it to my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now, I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that filthy dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
Slides up around the belly face down on the mattress one
And you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself, head made of the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

And I want something else
To get me through this life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

The sky was gold, it was rose (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)
I was taking sips of it to my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)
In the place we used to sta-a-a-a-art
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (I want something else)"

It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, ""I'm angry""
Five days since you laughed at me
Saying ""Get back together, come back and see me""
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry
Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me, but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know the vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, ""You're crazy""
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry


Chickity China, the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watching X-Files with no lights on, we're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic
Like Sting, I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films
'Kay, I don't make films, but if I did they'd have a samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs, gonna find the kind with tiny nubs just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gonna get in tune with Sailor Moon 'cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes that make me think the wrong thing

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to the sides and said, ""I'm sorry""
Five days since I laughed at you and said
""You just did just what I thought you were gonna do""
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame, but what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days 'til we say ""Wasabi""

Drove downtown in the rain
Nine-thirty on a Tuesday night
Just to check out the late-night record shop
Call it impulsive, call it compulsive, call it insane
But when I'm surrounded I just can't stop

It's a matter of instinct, it's a matter of conditioning
A matter of fact
You can call me Pavlov's dog
Ring a bell and I'll salivate
How'd you like that?
Dr. Landy tell me you're not just a pedagogue
Because right now I'm

Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
Well I'm
Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did

So I'm lying here just staring at the ceiling tiles
And I'm thinking about
Oh, what to think about
Just listening and re-listening to Smiley Smile
And I'm wondering if this is some kind of creative drought
Because I'm

Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
Well I'm
Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did

And if you want to find me I'll be out in the sandbox
Just wondering where the hell all the love has gone
I'm playing my guitar and building castles in the sun (whoa-oh)
And singing ""Fun, Fun, Fun""

Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
Well I'm
Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did

I had a dream that I was three hundred pounds
And though I was very heavy
I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground
I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground (whoa-oh)
Somebody help me
I couldn't see the ground
Somebody help me
I couldn't see the ground
Somebody help me
Because I'm

Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
Well I'm
Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did

Drove downtown in the rain

Call it impulsive, call it compulsive, you can call it insane

But still I feel so high
I wonder what you think
Sometimes I feel so old
I don't know if it's worth it
When I just do what I'm told

When I wake up tomorrow

You and I in a little toy shop
Buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got
Set them free at the break of dawn
'Til one by one they were gone
Back at base, bugs in the software
Flash the message, ""Something's out there""
Floatin' in the summer sky
Ninety-nine red balloons go by


Ninety-nine red balloons
Floatin' in the summer sky
Panic bells, it's red alert
There's somethin' here from somewhere else
The war machine, it springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
And focusin' it on the sky
As ninety-nine red balloons go by


99 Decision Street
Ninety-nine ministers meet
To worry, worry, super scurry
Call out the troops now in a hurry
This is what we've waited for
This is it, boys, this is war
The President is on the line
As ninety-nine red balloons go by


99 Kriegsminister
Streichholz und Benzinkanister
Hielten sich für schlaue Leute
Witterten schon fette Beute
Riefen ""Krieg!"" und wollten Macht
Mann, wer hätte das gedacht
Dass es einmal so weit kommt
Wegen 99 Luftballons?

99 Luftballons

Ninety-nine dreams I have had
In every one, a red balloon
It's all over, and I'm standin' pretty
In the dust that was a city
If I could find a souvenir
Just to prove the world was here
Then here it is, a red balloon
I think of you and let it go

So here I am, doing everything I can
Holding on to what I am, pretending I'm a superman

I'm trying to keep the ground on my feet
It seems the world's falling down around me
The nights are all long, I'm singing this song
To try and make the answers more than maybe

And I'm so confused about what to do
Sometimes I wanna throw it all away

So here I am, growing older all the time
Looking older all the time, feeling younger in my mind
And here I am, doing everything I can
Holding on to what I am, pretending I'm a superman

I'm trying to sleep, I lost count of sheep
My mind is racing faster every minute
What could I do more? Yeah, I'm really not sure
I know I'm running circles but I can't quit

And I'm so confused about what to do
Sometimes I wanna throw it all away

Controlling everything in sight, feeling weak, I don't feel right
You're telling me I have to change, telling me to act my age
But if all that I can do is just sit and watch time go
Then I'll have to say goodbye, life's too short to watch it fly
To watch it fly

So here I am, growing older all the time
Looking older all the time, feeling younger in my mind
And here I am, doing everything I can

Set me free
Let me be who and what I am
Why can't you see ?
You never seem to understand this pain I feel
Is as real as your ignorance
Question fate as I await deliverance

Like a fantastic fork
In bloody meat
Don't give me love, I wanna drown in your deep divide

Tumbleweed sew the seed in this ghost town
You never know what you'll see when the sun goes down
I saw her last in a dream she seems to astound
Heard of her first third verse, (216), hands bound
(Hands bound)

Taken from me in my mind
Empty without it inside
Starving I am the deprived
Just want it once...

Desires strong
Resistance is weak
It's hard to win when you've got so many mouths to feed

Set me free
Let me be who and what I am
Why can't you see?
You never seem to understand this pain I feel
Is as real as your ignorance
Question fate as I await deliverance

I could die for all of my sins
No not for that, for all that I have never had

This life's a fight for fulfilment (I've never had...)
Inside a war of my own hindsight
Look back with resentment
Taken as I find myself all alone...
All alone...
Taken from me"

No more, the crap rolls out your mouth again
Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatin
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about yourself instead?

Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?
Gossip burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much, you believe yourself
Judge not, lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou

Before you judge me, take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do?
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand

It's not who you are, it's who you know
Others' lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges and build them back with wealth
Judge not, lest ye be judged yourself

New blood joins this earth and quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules
With time, the child draws in, this whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on, he's known
Ooh, a vow onto his own, that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

They dedicate their lives to running all of his
He tries to please them all, this bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
That old man here is me, yeah

But something's wrong with all you see

Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God, help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, help me

Darkness, imprisoning me
All that I see, absolute horror

Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell"

One, two, one, two
I am the dominating Fresh Kid Ice
And I am the Brother Marquis, Marquis your brother
And introducing to you on the two turntables:
The Treach DJ Mr. Mixx
(*Scratch* word, word-word-word-*scratch*-word)

We get the red carpet treatment 'cause we're well respected
Always accepted and never rejected
Our defense is made when we take the stage
The crowd gets excited and goes in a rage
'Cause we're generating and demonstrating
All of the talents that we're accumulating
And by doing this we'll go real far
Because 2 Live is what we are
We're highly publicized and advertised
Our music's in your ear, our face in your eyes
We're good to go and goin' to be good
We've done the right thing like you knew we would
Because we are here for your dancing pleasure
With our microphones, 'cause that's what we treasure
Now the man you see who has hands of magic
His name is Mr. Mixx, so come on and scratch it

You can call me Brother Marquis, Marquis your brother
The T-E-S-T I pass with flying colors
I'm  and on the case
Gettin' straight to the point with no time to waste
The point is that this party needs to be rocked
With drummin' thumpin' beats around the clock
From odd to outspoken to opinionated
In need of a rhyme, I will create it
The best is yet to come with much much more
You got me rockin' you with my rhymes galore
Now my rhymes won't stop, my rhymes won't quit
Just give me the mic and I'll rock it
On to the break of dawn
I will rock y'all to the early morn'
'Cause I'm the demonstrating, the dominating
Annihilator, brutalor, MC-hatin'
So all MCs must step on off
'Cause I'm lettin' you know who's the boss
Now Kid Ice, you know you're twice as nice
Why don't you get up on the mic and start to recite?

'Cause they call me Kid Ice, the ladies' fire
When I enter a room, ladies fill with desire
Anytime I'm good, yes on the mic
I said the girls keep comin' back every night
'Cause I dress so fresh, my voice is clean
I can rock party people, yes even the Queen
In England, Germany, France and Japan
The ladies know that I'm the man
Who keep 'em from the kitchen just doin' their dishes
'Cause I have 'em in bed fulfillin' their wishes
I got a degree in makin' love
Yes, I got it from my father just up above
I could take a girl from any man
With a twitch of my lips or wave of a hand
So to all you guys out there tonight
Grab your girl, hold her tight
Say treat her with respect and treat her right
'Cause I might be in town for just one night

Word
Do it
1-2-3-4-5-6 do it
We're here
We're back

I'm the New York born, who's sharp as a thorn
I came here tonight just to get it on
So listen up close and listen up well
Cause the Brother Marquis has a story to tell
This is a story about an MC
Who got real brave and challenged me
He thought that he was bad, he thought he was tough
Until I, what, until I called his bluff
And as the battle began, his rhymes got weaker
You couldn't even hear his voice come out the speaker
And as he started to get ignored
The party people turned and walked off the floor
They did not applaud and they did not cheer
And homeboys just said ""Get the fuck outta here""
So as I cracked a smile and started to laugh
I could see the sucka duck muthafucka gettin mad
He had a frown on his face, he was hotter than fire
He wasn't competition but just a little biter
So, as he turned and walked away
With his head to the ground and nothing to say
Cause he was busted, disgusted, and couldn't be trusted
He tried to battle me and found self-DESTRUCTION

I met her in school and we did it on the bleachers
The kids were in gym as I went for a swim
I rocked her so good until she wanted it again
That was jet-set, so soft and wet
Now Keisha's on my tip, and that you can bet
Until one day I got caught in the act
With my girl named Melissa from a few days back
Keisha done called me up and asked me to explain
She said I played with her heart like it was a game

When you come to me all you do is ask
Cause your fulfillment is my only task
I won't mislead you or mistreat you
I'll just kiss, hug and squeeze you
When you think of me lovin's on your mind
It's written in the books that I'm one of a kind
I like makin' love seven days a week
Not like your man, I'm just a freak
Your man did you wrong, now it's my turn
After all his dick, I knew you would learn
Cause there ain't another who can rock your world
Just open those legs and let me— (Get it girl)

It's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see
I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothing's going to change the way we live
'Cause we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse
See, its a crazy world we're living in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground
And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother, can choose a color
Of her child
That's not nature's way
Well that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new religion
Whoa, it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these
Futures that we have to be told
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground
Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothing so bad. (happiness)
Oh yeah
I know yeah
Oh this virtual insanity we're living in
Has got to change, yeah
Things will never be the same
And I can't go on
Well we're living, oh oh
Virtual insanity
Oh this world has got to change
'Cause I just, I just can't keep going on
In this virtual, virtual insanity
That we're living in, that we're living in
That virtual insanity is what is
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground, oh
Futures made of that virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by our love
For useless, twisting, of that new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground, yes we do
Virtual insanity is all we ever know
Yeah is all I have"

And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs

Here I am

And I'm wondering what it is I should do
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face
Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place

Well, you started out with nothing
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your friends, they all come crawling
Slap you on the back and say
Please
Please

Trying to make some sense of it all
But I can see it makes no sense at all
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor?
'Cause I don't think that I can take anymore

And you're proud that you're a self-made man

Hey, where did we go?
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughin' and a-runnin', hey, hey
Skippin' and a jumpin'
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a thumpin'

And you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall

With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-tee-da?
Just like that
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-tee-da
La-tee-da

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium

With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-tee-da? (Lyin' on the green grass)

Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
In '65, I was seventeen and running up 101
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on

Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive
In '69, I was twenty-one and I called the road my own
I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on

Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

Everyone I know, everywhere I go
People need some reason to believe
I don't know about anyone but me
If it takes all night, that'll be all right
If I can get you to smile before I leave

Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels
Look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through
Looking into their eyes I see them running too

Running on, running on empty, yeah
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

Honey, you really tempt me
You know the way you look so kind
I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind
(Running on)
You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find
(Running blind)
Running into the sun but I'm running behind

Thank you!"

And brought 'em all together for one night
I know they'd never match my sweet imagination
And everything looks worse in black and white

And she ran to the police station
When the papa found out, he began to shout
And he started the investigation

The mama looked down and spit on the ground
Every time my name gets mentioned
The papa said ""Oy, if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention""

But the press let the story leak
Now when the radical priest come to get me released
We was all on the cover of Newsweek

As the war machine keeps turning

Poisoning their brainwashed minds

Oh, Lord, yeah

They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that all to the poor, yeah
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait till their judgment day comes, yeah


Now, in darkness, world stops turning
Ashes where their bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgment, God is calling
On their knees, the war pigs crawling
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings

Got a crazy feeling I don't understand
Got to get away from here
Feeling like I should have kept my feet on the ground
Waiting for the sun to appear

I've been a bad, bad boy
No use saying sorry
It's something that I enjoy

Because you can't see what my eyes see
(I can see it, I can see it)
And you can't be inside of me
Flying high again
I can see through mountains, watch me disappear
I can even touch the sky
Swallowing colours of the sound I hear
Am I just a crazy guy (you bet)

Mamma's going to worry
I've been a bad, bad boy
No use saying sorry
It's something that I enjoy

If you could be inside my head
You'd see that black and white is red
Flying high again

Come on and join me

Over the mountains, take me across the sky
Something in my visions, something deep inside
Where did I wander? Where do you think I wandered to?
I've seen life's magic, astral plane I travel through

I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now
I told them I had ridden shooting stars and said I'd show them how

Over and over, always tried to get away
Living in a daydream, only place I had to stay
Fever of a breakout burning in me miles wide
People around me talking to the walls inside

I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now
I told them I had ridden shooting stars and said I'd show them how

Don't need no astrology, it's inside of you and me
You don't need a ticket to fly with me, I'm free, yeah


Over and under, in between the ups and downs
Mind on a carpet, magic ride goes around and 'round
Over the mountain, kissing silver inlaid clouds
Watching my body disappear into the crowds

Don't need no astrology, it's inside of you and me
You don't need a ticket to fly with me, I'm free, yeah"

Don't confuse win or lose, it's up to you
It's up to you

I'm moving through some changes
I'll never be the same
Something you did touched me
There's no one else to blame

The love we had has fallen
The love we used to share
We've given up pretending
As if you didn't care

Change, changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Capitalize on this good fortune
One word can bring you round
Changes

I look into the mirror
I see no happiness
All the warmth I gave you
Has turned to emptiness

The love we had has fallen
The love we used to share
You've left me here believing
In love that wasn't there

Change, changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Word to the wise
Well, you get what's coming
One word can bring you round
Changes

But when I look into your eyes
And try to find out how
There's no way to save it now
And everything I feel

Changes
Keep looking for
Changes
Changes


For some reason, you're questioning why
I always believed it gets better
One difference between you and I
Your heart is inside your head

One word from you, one word from me
A clear design on your liberty
Who could believe when love has gone
How we move on like everyone?

Only such fools
Only such jealous hearts
Only through love changes come

Change, changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Capitalize on this good fortune
One word can bring you round
Changes

It's always the same
(One road to happiness)

Or to make a table stand
And it takes three wheels to make a vehicle
And call it a tricycle

Every triangle has three sides
No more, no less

To move away, do you hear what I say

So don't you be around

Tonight there's gonna be trouble

See, the boys and me mean business
Bustin' out dead or alive
I can hear the hound dogs on my trail
All hell breaks loose, alarm and sirens wail
Like the game if you lose
Go to jail

So don't you be around

Tonight there's gonna be trouble

Just like a stranger to me
But all the games you play
Make it so easy to see

You're looking for love
Though you try to deny
The things you put me through
Tell me what I've got to do to you

I'm gonna slide it in—Right to the top
Slide it in—I ain't never gonna stop
Slide it in—Right to the top

You've such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Somethin' to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find somethin' in there
To give me just what I need?
Another reason to bleed
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
One by one, hidden up my sleeve

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down

Will I find a believer?
Another one who believes?
Another one to deceive?
Over and over, down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on, I got nothin' to hide
On and on, I got nothin' to hide

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down

All my life, I've been searchin' for somethin'
Somethin' never comes, never leads to nothin'
Nothin' satisfies, but I'm gettin' close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long, I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feelin' that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Then I'm done, done, onto the next one
Done, done, and I'm onto the next one
Done, done, and I'm onto the next one
Done, done, and I'm onto the next one
Done, done, and I'm onto the next one
Done, done, and I'm onto the next one
Done, done, and I'm onto the next one
Done, I'm done, and I'm onto the next
Done, done, onto the next one!
Done, I'm done, and I'm onto the next one!
Done, done, onto the next one!
Done, I'm done, and I'm onto the next!

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste

Hey, don't let it go to waste

I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Are you gone and on to someone new?

I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you? Oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love you'd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

I've got another confession, my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you? Oh"

Hello, I've waited here for you

Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red, out of her head, she sang
Do do do do do do dododo

Do do do do do do do do

Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow, how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head, out of her head, she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
Do do do do do do dododo
Do do do do do do dododo
Do do do do do do do do

Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now, I know you've always been
Out of your head, out of my head, I sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
So, dad would take the Sundays off
And that's the only time he could ever get any rest
And so, because we were loud on Sundays
He'd make us hold his construction boots over our head, 'til we'd sleep
And they were really heavy boots and I used to say, ""Dad, come on, please""
And like start crying, 'cause they're too heavy

And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when"

Hook me up a new revolution, 'cause this one is a lie

It disappeared with time, it never made much sense
Adolescent resident
Wasting another night on plannin' my revenge

I'll never be your monkey wrench

All this time to make amends
What do you do when all your enemies are friends?
Now and then, I'll try to bend
Under pressure, wind up snapping in the end

One last thing before I quit
I never wanted any more than
I could fit into my head
I still remember every single word you said
And all the shit that somehow came along with it
Still, there's one thing that comforts me
Since I was always caged and now I'm free!

Well, it was all that I could do to keep from cryin'
Sometimes it seemed so useless to remain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me by my name

You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
And you don't have to call me Charlie Pride
And you don't have to call me Merle Haggard anymore
Even though you're on my fightin' side

And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me by my name

Well, I've heard my name a few times in your phone book (Hello, hello)
And I've seen it on signs where I've played
But the only time I know I'll hear ""David Allan Coe""
Is when Jesus has his final judgment day

So I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me by my name

Well, a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song
And he told me it was the perfect country and western song
I wrote him back a letter, and I told him it was not the perfect country and western song
Because he hadn't said anything at all about Mama, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or gettin' drunk
Well, he sat down and wrote another verse to the song and he sent it to me
And after reading it, I realized that my friend had written the perfect country and western song
And I felt obliged to include it on this album
The last verse goes like this here

Well, I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison
And I went to pick her up in the rain
But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
She got run over by a damned old train

And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain
No, ah, you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me
Well, I wonder why you don't call me
Why don't you ever call me by my name?"

I guess he ain't read the signs that say that I been to prison
Someone ought to warn him 'fore I knock him off his chair

Because my long hair just can't cover up my red neck
I've won every fight I've ever fought
Hey, I don't need some turkey telling me that I ain't country
And saying I ain't worth the damned old ticket that he bought
'Cause I can sing all them songs about Texas
And I still do all the sad ones that I know
They tell me I look like Merle Haggard
And sound a lot like David Allan Coe

And the barmaid in the last town that we played in
Knew the words to every song I'd wrote
She said Jimmy Rabbit turned her on to my last album
Just about the time the jukebox broke

Yeah, Johnny Cash helped me get out of prison
Long before Rodriguez stole that goat
I've been the Rhinestone Cowboy for so long I can't remember
And I can do you every song Hank Williams ever wrote

And I can sing all them songs about Texas
And I still do all the sad ones that I know
I can't help it, I look like Merle Haggard

Had my guitar on my back
When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac
He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed
Said, ""It's a long walk to Nashville, would you like a ride, son?""
Well I sat down in the front seat and turned on the radio
And them sad old songs coming out of them speakers was solid country gold
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost-white pale
When he asked me for a light
And I knew there was something strange about this ride
He said
""Drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing?
Have you paid your dues, can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them, guitar strings?""
He said, ""Boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
Cause if you're big star bound let me warn ya
It's a long, hard ride""
Then he cried just south of Nashville
And he turned that car around
He said
""This is where you get off boy. I'm goin' back to Alabam.""
As I stepped out of that Cadillac I said, ""Mr., many thanks""
He said, ""You don't have to call me Mister, Mister

""Drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing?

And you don't have to call me Charlie Pride
And you don't have to call me Merle Haggard anymore
Even though you're on my fightin' side

And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me by my name

Well, I've heard my name a few times in your phone book (Hello, hello)
And I've seen it on signs where I've played
But the only time I know I'll hear ""David Allan Coe""
Is when Jesus has his final judgment day

So I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me by my name

Well, a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song
And he told me it was the perfect country and western song
I wrote him back a letter, and I told him it was not the perfect country and western song
Because he hadn't said anything at all about Mama, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or gettin' drunk
Well, he sat down and wrote another verse to the song and he sent it to me
And after reading it, I realized that my friend had written the perfect country and western song
And I felt obliged to include it on this album
The last verse goes like this here

Well, I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison
And I went to pick her up in the rain
But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
She got run over by a damned old train

And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain
No, ah, you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me
Well, I wonder why you don't call me
Why don't you ever call me by my name?"

All my rowdy friends have settled down
And they seem to be more into laid back songs
Nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
Everybody just wants to go back home

I, myself, have seen my wilder days
And I have seen my name at the top of the page
But I need to find a friend just to run around
But nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

And I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a ""Lost Highway""
And old George Jones, I'm glad to see, is finally getting straight
And Waylon's staying home and loving Jessi more these days
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

Ow!

And the hangovers hurt more than they used to
And corn bread and ice teas took the place of pills and 90-proof
And it seems like none of us do things quite like we used to do
And nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

Yeah, I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a ""Lost Highway""
And Johnny Cash don't act like he did back in '68
And Kris, he is a movie star and he's moved off to L.A..
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

Yeah, me and my rowdy friends done rowdied on down"

The Devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
And he was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped up on a hickory stump
And said ""Boy, let me tell you what""

""I guess you didn't know it, but I am a fiddle player too
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle o' gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you""
The boy said, ""My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet and you're gonna regret 'cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made a evil hiss
And then a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this


When the Devil finished, Johnny said
""Well, you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

""Fire on the Mountain,"" run, boys, run
The Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no


The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
I done told you once, you son of a bitch, I'm the best there's ever been""

He played ""Fire on the Mountain,"" run, boys, run
The Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
The chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, will your dog bite? No, child, no"

I'm into Lynyrd Skynyrd

I like Willie, Waylon, George, and Merle
And alot of ZZ Top
They play country, soul with some rock and roll
And I hope they never stop

'cause I'm a redneck

I don't like no new wave disco bands around
I'm gonna drink a couple dozen beers
Go out and jam some gears
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the south
I've got a 1965 Harley chopper
It sure makes those women stare
A dead flamingo wrapped around the cowboy hats I wear
I can cuss I can fight I can spit I can belch I can raise all kinds of hell
If you ride to live like I live to ride let me hear some rebel yells

And I'm a redneck
A rock-n-roll son of the south
I don't like no new wave disco bands around
I'm gonna drink a couple dozen beers
Go out and jam some gears
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the south

I like my whiskey straight up
Daqueri just makes me ill
If someone touches my cowboy hat I get mad enough to kill
I got a rifle rack in my pickup truck
I'm a four wheelin' maniac
And if you wanna race name the place
I'll show you where it's at muther fucker

And I'm a redneck

Digs getting downright strange
But I can keep a handle on anything

And this is what she had to say

And pure as the driven slush
And that's not jewelry she's talking 'bout

She likes cocaine
And flipping out with Great Danes
She's about all I can handle
It's too much for my brain

I'm gonna give her a message
Here's what I'm gonna say

And hurt me real, real bad
By the roadside in a ditch

Go for a pallet that's so nice and thin
Zip it on around while it's on the ground
Spread it out and lay it on down

You're afraid of the dark, baby, no need to be shy
We'll talk about some loving while we look at the sky
Don't be hesitating, it'll be alright
We'll tuck it in until it's clean out of sight

Slip inside my sleeping bag
Slip inside my sleeping bag

Let's go out to Egypt because it's in the plan
Sleep beside the Pharaohs in the shifting sand
We'll look at some pyramids and check out some heads
Oh, we'll whip out our mattress 'cause there ain't no beds

With so much drama in L-B-C
It's kinda hard bein Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, I somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky ass shit like every single day
And can I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few friends as I breeze through
Don't you know it's two in the mornin'
And the party's still jumpin'
Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the living room gettin' me horny
They ain't leavin' 'til six in the mornin'
So, what you wanna do
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what?) we don't love them whores
And we gonna smoke a ounce to that
G's up, hoes down, like you motherfuckers bounce to this
And I'll be

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind, y'all

I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got their cup but they ain't chipped in
You know, this type of shit happens all the time
You gotta get yours before I get mine
Everything is fine when you listenin' to the D-O-G
He's got the cultivatin' music that be captivatin' me
But, who hears the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
I started mackin' with this bitch named Sadie
You know, she used to be the homeboy's lady
Don't you know it's eighty degrees
When I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-Ts
'Cause you gets none of these at ease
As I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
And I'll be

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind

So later on that day
My homie Dr. Dre
He came by with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat-ass J
Of some bubonic chronic
You know it made me choke, it ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it, set my cup of gin down
Don't you know
Tanqueray and chronic, well, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin'
I'm still poppin'
Dr. Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I bust my nut, you know I'm raisin' up off the cot
But don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, that's why I'm out the door, and I'll be

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice bi-atch
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo

And pulled out the suntan lotion
Now I thought that was fast, but this girl was faster
She's lookin' for a real good time

And I ran away with the bottle of wine

Take the bass line out
Uh-huh, Jigga
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
Let it bump though

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

I flow for those 'dro'ed out
All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks
We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back
Daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, ""Still, y'all don't know me.""
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin' – feel me?

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!"

That you've already gone away

Misjudged your limit
Pushed you too far
Took you for granted

But I just keep on laughing

You can't even see now, so you ask me the way
You wonder if it's real because it couldn't be rain
Through the right doorway and into the white room
It used to be the dust that would lay here when I came here alone

But I don't care if you don't
And I don't feel if you don't
And I don't want it if you don't
And I won't play it if you won't play it first

Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo

You're so gorgeous I'll do anything
I'll kiss you from your feet to where your head begins
You're so perfect, you're so right as rain
You make me, make me, make me, make me hungry again

Everything you do is irresistible
Everything you do is simply kissable
Why can't I be you?

I'll run around in circles until I run out of breath
I'll eat you all up or I'll just hug you to death
You're so wonderful, too good to be true
You make me, make me, make me, make me hungry for you

Everything you do is simply delicate
Everything you do is quite angelicate
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?

You turn my head when you turn around
You turn the whole world upside down
I'm smitten, I'm bitten, I'm hooked, I'm cooked, I'm stuck like glue
You make me, make me, make me, make me hungry for you

Everything you do is simply dreamy
Everything you do is quite delicious
So why can't I be you?

Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
You're simply elegant"

Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured, silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle, monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle, monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the Fistagons, the bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord

Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio

Contact, I hijacked the frequencies
Blockin' the beltway, move on DC
Way past the days of bombin' MCs
Sound off, Mumia, guan, be free
Who got 'em? Yo, check the federal file
All you pen devils know the trial was vile
Army of pigs try to silence my style
Off 'em all out the box, it's my radio dial

Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up

It has to start sometime
What better place than here?

Everything's so blurry and everyone's so fake
And everybody's empty and everything is so messed up
Preoccupied, without you, I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

You could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I'll protect you from all of the obscene
I wonder what you're doing, imagine where you are
There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face

Everyone is changing, there's no one left that's real
So make up your own ending and let me know just how you feel
'Cause I am lost without you, I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

And you could be my someone, you could be my scene
Know that I will save you from all of the unclean
I wonder what you're doing, I wonder where you are
There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far

Can you take it all away?

My name is Mud
My name is Mud

Not to be confused with Bill or Jack or Pete or Dennis
My name is Mud, it's always been
'Cause I'm the most boring sonsabitch you've ever seen
I dress in blue, yes, navy blue
From head to toe I'm rather drab except my patent shoes
I make 'em shine, well most the time
'Cept today my feet were troddin’ on by this friend of mine
Six foot two and rude as hell
I got to get him in the ground before he starts to smell

My name is Mud


My name is Mud
But call me Aloysius Devadander Abercrombie, that's long for Mud
So I've been told
Told that by this sonsabitch that lies before me
Bloated, blue and cold
I've got my pride, I drink my wine
I'd drink only the finest
'Cept I haven't earned a dime in several months, or were it years?
The breath on that fat bastard could bring any man to tears
We had our words, a common spat
So I kissed him upside the cranium
With that aluminum baseball bat

My name is Mud
My name is Mud
M-M-M-M-M-Mud
My name is Mud

Where you goin', city boy?"

I sleep with the TV on
So I don't feel so alone
This house is an empty wreck
It's a perfect match for its perfect guests
Inbetween gettin' pizza's delivered
And going to the store for beer
Well, I sit here any day and night
Wondering why I'm here

It's like my body and soul
Can't take it anymore
Please, somebody help me
I never wanted help before

I didn't cry the day my mama died
I don't think I even flinched
But I broke down this morning
When I saw these two kids kiss
Something's running around inside me
That I really don't understand
Now I know something's gotta change
I just don't know if I can

It's like my body and soul
Can't take it anymore
Please, somebody help me
I never wanted help before

It's like my body and soul
Can't take it anymore
Please, somebody help me
I never wanted help before

I've wanted to kill myself
But I always been too scared
My life is like sideways rains
Swirl around in the air
I've been searchin' most of my life
For anything to believe in
Like God or love or something
Any kind of simple solution

It's like my body and soul
Can't take it anymore
Please, somebody help me
I never wanted help before

It's like my body and soul
Can't take it anymore

Sometimes I think about my sister
Sometimes I think about myself
Well she's this born-again christian
And me well I don't believe in anything
I called her on the phone the other day
My lover-bug was so far away
Sometimes I think about my sister
Sometimes I think about myself
Sometimes I cry about my sister
Sometimes I cry about myself...

I think my dad was a racist
Or maybe he was just an ignorant who knows
Well he thought all black people stole from you
And he didn't like mexicans, he didn't care for jews, no, no
Still I wish he was alive today
So we could go off to a dodger game and talk

Well I'll tell him what I believe
And he'll just sit there and listen to the, yin and change

Because blood is thicker than water
Oh yea, blood is thicker than water
At least that's what they say, ah that's what they say
But I don't know, yea I don't know

Well my friends they're important to me
Sure more than any family ever has been
They're the ones that bailed me out of jail
They're the ones that picked me up every time I failed
Well I love them and they love me
And they don't worry if I'm not what they want me to be

Ah 'cause blood is thicker than water
Oh yea, blood is thicker than water
At least that's what they say, that's what they say
But I don't know, yea I don't know

I swore I'd never ever be like my dad
He smoked and drank and yelled at everyone

I swore I'd never ever be like him
But now i look in the mirror and there he is, yeah
I swore I'd never ever be like him
I swore I'd never ever be like him

But, blood is thicker than water
Oh yea, blood is thicker than water
At least that's what they say, that's what they say
But I don't know, yea I don't know

I know an old-timer
Just a nickel-and-dimer
At the bar down the Adios Lounge
And for whiskey and smokes
Recites poems and jokes
But he's not just your average clown
And he's entertaining nightly
Down the Adios Lounge
And he puts it politely
But he does lay it down

Now I lie here alone in my bed
With these words running wild in my head
He said

Don't let nobody go there for you
Don't be satisfied with a second-hand life
Don't let nobody stifle or bore you
Handle your troubles or take on your strife
Don't let nobody live your life for you
Not your friends, not your kids, no not even your wife
If you wanna know where the rainbow ends
It's you who’s got to go there and find it my friend

So I'm going back down
To the Adios Lounge
Where there's no one to wait up for me
I hope he's still around
Oh, that crazy old scrounge
To tell us how things ought to be
He said

Don't let nobody go there for you
Don't be satisfied with a second-hand life
Don't let nobody stifle or bore you
Handle your troubles or take on your strife
Don't let nobody live your life for you
Not your friends, not your kids, no not even your wife
If you want to know where the rainbow ends
It's you who've got to go there and find it my friend

So I buy him more drinks
Just to hear what he thinks
Oh, it's worth it to see him almost smile
It's worth feeling free for a while
At the bar down the Adios Lounge
At the bar down the Adios Lounge

Not goofy like Darrin or Hazel
I'm a motherfuckin' Nick at Nite
With classics rerunning that you know all right

Now remain calm, no alarm
'Cause my farm ain't fat
So what's up with that?
I've got friends and family that I respect
When I think I'm too good, they put me in check
So believe when I say I'm no better than you
Except when I rap, so I guess it ain't true
Like that, y'all, and you just don't stop
Guaranteed to make your body rock

Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this muthafucking party out

I said, ""Doc, what's the condition?
I'm a man that's on a mission""
He said, ""Son, you'd better listen
Stuck in your ass is an electrician""
Like a scientist
Mmm, when I'm applying this
Method of controlling my mind
Like Einstein and the Rapping Duke combined

Now, hey, baby bubba, now what's the deal?
I didn't know you go for that mass appeal
Some call it salugi, some hot potato
I stole your mic, but you won't see it later
'Cause I work magic like a magician
I add up, the mathematician
I'm a bank cashier, engineer
I wear cotton and I don't wear sheer

Shazam and abracadabra
In the whip, I'm gonna cruise past ya
Yo, money, don't chump yourself
Put that shit back on the shelf
Light rays blazing, you're out of phase, and my crew's amazing
We're working on the record, yo, so just stay patient

Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfucking party out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out

Now, I go by the name of the King Ad-Rock
I don't wear a cup nor a jock
I bring the shit that's beyond bizarre
Like Miss Piggy (Who, moi?)
I am the one with the clientele
You say, ""Ad-Rock, you rock so well""
I've got class like pink champale
MCA, grab the mic before the mic goes stale

Don't test me, they can't arrest me
I'll fake right, cross-over and shoot lefty
You look upset, yo, calm down
You look like Cable Guy dunked off of your crown
I flow like smoke out a chimney
You never been me
You wanna rap but what you're making ain't hip-hop, B

Now-
Get your clothes right out the dryer
Put Armor All up on your tire
Sport that fresssssh attire
Tonight we goin' out, set the town on fire
Set the town ablaze
Gonna stun and amaze
Ready to throw a craze
Make your granny shake her head and say ""those were the days""

Now check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfucking party out"

Crossroads, seem to come and go, yeah
The gypsy flies from coast to coast
Knowing many, loving none
Bearing sorrow having fun
But back home he'll always run
To sweet Melissa

Freight train, each car looks the same, all the same
And no one knows the Gypsy's name
No one hears his lonely sighs
There are no blankets where he lies
In all his deepest dreams the Gypsy flies
With sweet Melissa

Again the morning's come
Again he's on the run
Sunbeams shining through his hair
Appearing not to have a care
Well, pick up your gear and Gypsy roll on, roll on

Crossroads, will you ever let him go? No, no, no
Will you hide the dead man's ghost?
Or will he lie, beneath the clay?
Or will his spirit float away?
But I know that he won't stay without Melissa
Yes I know that he won't stay without Melissa"

You must have been in a
Place so dark
You couldn't feel the light
Reachin' for you through
That stormy cloud
Now here we are
Gathered in our little hometown
This can't be the way
You meant to draw a crowd

Oh why, that's what I keep asking
Was there anything I could've
Said or done
Oh, I had no clue you were masking
A troubled soul, God only knows
What went wrong and why
You would leave the stage
In the middle of a song

Now in my mind I'll keep you frozen
As a seventeen-year-old
Rounding third to score the winning run
You always played with passion
No matter what the game
When you took the stage
You'd shine just like the sun

Oh why, that's what I keep asking
Was there anything I could've
Said or done
Oh, I had no clue you were masking
A troubled soul, , God only knows
What went wrong and why
You would leave the stage
In the middle of a song

Now the oak trees are swaying
In the early autumn breeze
A golden sun is shining on my face
Through tangled thoughts
I hear a mockingbird sing
This old world really ain't that
Bad of a place

Oh why, there's no comprehending
And who am I to try to judge or explain
Oh, but I do have one burning question
Who told you life wasn't worth the fight
They were wrong, they lied
Now you're gone and we cry
Cause it's not like you to walk away
In the middle of a song

Your beautiful song
Your absolutely beautiful song"

Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're goin' to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibi
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside


I'm comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine

While he's havin' a smoke and she's taking a drag

This we must leave and get undone
We must engage and rearrange
And turn this planet back to one
So tell me why we got to die
And kill each other one by one
We've got to hug and rub-a-dub
We've got to dance and be in love

But what I really want to know is
Are you going to go my way?
And I got to, got to know

I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feelin' right
We started makin' out, and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?


And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
(What's my age again?)
(What's my age again?)
That's about the time that she broke up with me
(Please stay with me)
No one should take themselves so seriously
(Please stay with me)
With many years ahead to fall in line
(Please stay with me)
Why would you wish that on me?
(Please stay) I never wanna act my age
(With) What's my age again?
(Me) What's my age again?

Sometimes I feel the fear of
Uncertainty stinging clear
And I, I can't help but ask myself
How much I let the fear take the wheel and steer

Haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
Should be the one behind the wheel

Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there, yeah, ohh

So if I decide to waiver my
Chance to be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive?
Ohh-oh-ohh

It's driven me before, and it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I'm beginning to find that
When I drive myself my light is found

And whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there, yeah, ohh


Would you choose the water over wine
Hold the wheel and drive?

Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah

Findin' nothin' but questions and devils

Could you make it on your own?

And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then, I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

When you put me on the Wolverine

It was still September
When your daddy was quite surprised
To find you with the working girls
In the county jail

I was smoking with the boys upstairs
When I heard about the whole affair

I said oh no
William and Mary won't do, now
Well I did not think the girl
Could be so cruel
And I'm never going back
To my old school

Oleanders growing outside her door
Soon they're gonna be in bloom
Up in Annandale
I can't stand her
Doing what she did before
Living like a gypsy queen
In a fairy tale

Well I hear the whistle but I can't go
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico

She said whoa no
Guadalajara won't do, now
Well I did not think the girl
Could be so cruel
And I'm never going back
To my old school


California tumbles into the sea
That'll be the day I go
Back to Annandale
Tried to warn you
About Chino and Daddy Gee
But I can't seem to get to you
Through the U.S. Mail

Well I hear the whistle but I can't go

She said oh no

I spend a lot of money
And I spent a lot of time
The trip we made to Hollywood
Is etched upon my mind
After all the things we've done and seen
You find another man
The things you think are useless
I can't understand

I've seen your picture
Your name in lights above it
This is your big debut
It's like a dream come true
So won't you smile for the camera?
I know they're gonna love it
Peg

I like your pin shot
I keep it with your letter
Done up in blueprint blue
It sure looks good on you
And when you smile for the camera
I know I'll love you better

Peg, it will come back to you
Peg, it will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3-D
It's your favorite foreign movie


I like your pin shot
I keep it with your letter
Done up in blueprint blue
It sure looks good on you
And when you smile for the camera
I know I'll love you better

Peg, it will come back to you
Peg, it will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3-D

This is the day of the expanding man
That shape is my shade
There where I used to stand
It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
At ramblers, wild gamblers
That's all in the past

You call me a fool
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real
I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
I'll make it this time
I'm ready to cross that fine line

Learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)

My back to the wall
A victim of laughing chance
This is for me
The essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love
With those of my kind
Libations, sensations
That stagger the mind

I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
I'll rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home

Learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)


This is the night of the expanding man
I take one last drag
As I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long
This brother is free
I'll be what I want to be

I'll learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)"

Victorious Victorias kneel for brand-new spanking deals
Marching forward, hypocritic and hypnotic computers

Dancin' in the desert, blowin' up the sunshine

Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox, stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying, ""Freedom!""
Handed to obsoletion; still, you feed us lies from the tablecloth

I've been sellin' my soul, workin' all day
Overtime hours for bullshit pay
So I can sit out here and waste my life away
Drag back home and drown my troubles away

It's a damn shame what the world's gotten to
For people like me and people like you
Wish I could just wake up and it not be true
But it is, oh, it is

Livin' in the new world
With an old soul

Lord knows they all just wanna have total control
Wanna know what you think, wanna know what you do
And they don't think you know, but I know that you do
'Cause your dollar ain't shit and it's taxed to no end
'Cause of rich men north of Richmond

I wish politicians would look out for miners
And not just minors on an island somewhere
Lord, we got folks in the street, ain't got nothin' to eat
And the obese milkin' welfare
Well, God, if you're five-foot-three and you're three-hundred pounds
Taxes ought not to pay for your bags of Fudge Rounds
Young men are puttin' themselves six feet in the ground
'Cause all this damn country does is keep on kickin' them down

Lord, it's a damn shame what the world's gotten to
For people like me and people like you
Wish I could just wake up and it not be true
But it is, oh, it is

Livin' in the new world
With an old soul

Lord knows they all just wanna have total control
Wanna know what you think, wanna know what you do
And they don't think you know, but I know that you do

I go to work like a doctor
When I rock the mic, you got to like
The way I operate, I make miracles happen
Just from rappin', I'm so lyrically potent
And I'm flowin' and explodin'
On the scene mean, I got the potential
To make you go then chill
I got the credentials that are so essential
To make a rhyme send chills, then you know I will fulfill
To make a couple of mill as I build a guild
For all the rappers of skill
And kill the weak rappers with no thrills
Hang 'em in effigy
If he's a sucker, hang 'em to the left of me
'Cause my right-hand man is my mic stand and
The microphone that I own and my game plan
Is keepin' at a steady pace
Ain't no reason to rush, it ain't no race
I'ma hit the top just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time and I'm gonna
'Cause I know when to go 'head into
The classic Moe Dee rap that sent ya
Runnin' around, holdin' ya head
Asking your homeboy ""Yo man, you heard what he said?""
Another funky rhythm, look at your man and give him
A high five 'cause I'm live runnin' around with him
Telling everybody hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up and check the clock
Punch it, I go to work

I go to work
I go to work

I go to work like an architect
I build a rhyme sometimes it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word
With each letter, it becomes visibly better
'Cause my foundation built a nation
Of rappers and after I came off vacation
I came to roam the land I own
And stand alone on the microphone, Daddy's home
So open the door, playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
A taste of the bass and who's the ace
Start the race, I'm coming in first
With each verse, I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
And after I have ya, I have to slap ya
Senseless with endless rhymes, don't pretend this
Is anything short of stupendous, and when this
Rhyme is done, your mind will become
So trapped in the rap, you'll lust another one
But you gotta wait, it takes time
I don't write, I build a rhyme
Draw the plans, draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one
I go to work

I go to work
I go to work

I go to work, like a boxer
Train the brain and aim to outfox ya
Like a punch, my rhyme rocks ya
Sometimes it knocks ya so hard it stops ya
Dead in your tracks, so power packed
Before you can react, you're flat on your back
Down for the count, get up and dismount
'Cause I'm coming with an endless amount
Of rhymes in a hurry like a flurry
A collage to camouflage the power punch, but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote, I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight I wrote
Rhymes at a level, so you can't relate
Unless you're intelligent, so stay awake
Sleepwalkers, slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil's
Writing a rhyme in its highest form
And I'ma drop it on ya like a bomb
And when it explodes, I'll blow up
A few casualties, but so what?
If you're slow, you blow; you know you go
I flow I throw all-pro, I go to work


To say rap is not work is ludicrous
Whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me, you'll compare me
To a prophet for profit, not merely
Putting words together for recreation
Each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation?
I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work"

When routine bites hard
And ambitions are low
And resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways
Taking different roads

Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Why is the bedroom so cold?
You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed?
Our respect runs so dry
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives

But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again


You cry out in your sleep
All my failings exposed
There's a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold
Is it something so good
Just can't function no more?

But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Then love, love will tear it apart again

The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path

The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paperboy brings more

And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

The lunatic is in my head (*laughter*)
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You rearrange me 'till I'm sane
You lock the door and throw away the key
And there's someone in my head, but it's not me

And if the cloudbursts thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear (Oh, woah)
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes (Hey, hey, hey)
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon! (Oh, oh, oh)

I can't think of anything to say except...
*laughter*
I think it's marvellous!

Headed down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbin' my way to North Caroline
Starin' up the road
And pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh
I can see my baby tonight

So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey, mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey, mama rock me

Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time string band
My baby plays the guitar
I pick a banjo now
Ah, the north country winters keep a-gettin' me
And I lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave
But I ain't a-turnin' back
To livin' that old life no more

So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey, mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey, mama rock me

Walkin' due south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly
Had a nice long toke
But he's a-headed west from the Cumberland Gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name
And I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh
At least I will die free

So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey, mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey, mama rock me"

Oh yeah, aw
What we're livin' in?
Let me tell ya

Yeah, it's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doin' for us?
And I'm givin' all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see, I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothin's going to change the way we live
'Cause we can always take, but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse, see
Woah, it's a crazy world we're livin' in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these

Futures made of virtual insanity
Now always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless twisting of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound
For we all live underground

And I'm thinkin', what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother can choose the colour
Of her child
That's not nature's way
Well, that's what they said yesterday
There's nothin' left to do but pray
I think it's time to find a new religion
Whoa, it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these futures that we have to be told

Futures made of virtual insanity
Now always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless twisting of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound
For we all live underground, whoa!

Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothin' so bad
As a man-made' man
Oh yeah, I know, yeah (take it to the dance floor)

I know I can't go on
Of this virtual insanity we're living in
Has got to change, yeah
Things will never be the same
And I can't go on
Where we're living in
Oh, oh, virtual insanity
Oh, this world
Has got to change
'Cause I just
I just can't keep going on in this virtual, virtual insanity
That we're living in, that we're living in
And that virtual insanity is what is, yeah

Oooooooh...

Now always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless twisting of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound
For we all live underground

Now we all, we seem to be governed by a love
For these useless twisting of our new technology
And now there is no sound, for we all live underground

The embers glowin' orange, logs are stacked and the smoke rises higher
And you're preachin' to the choir when you say the rapids from the river couldn't drown this fire

And the leaves weren't the only thing fallin'
I stare out the window and wait
I watched it all play out in an instant
I wasn't afraid

The glory of a backroad, I sat shotgun and sang harmony beside her
From the blue ridge to the coast, the notes they flow just like the ghost of Carolina

And the leaves weren't the only thing falling
I stare out the window and wait
I watched it all play out in an instant
I wasn't afraid

And I know now what's worth fighting for
I feel you in my bones
Filled to the brim and wanting more
A love I've never known
Never known

We're on 40 East now, not much longer babe, we'll be home soon
But honestly you and me, we can be broke down and that'd be fine too

And the leaves weren't the only thing falling
I stare out the window and wait
I watched it all play out in an instant
I wasn't afraid
I wasn't afraid"

All that’s left of her is high heels and a slouch
Her friends ain’t around

They’ll get another round
On the other side of town

Sweat drips out of every pore as
I bite you more and more and more and
Take one last look at your captor
And hear my tail rattling 'til your death
Rattling 'til your death

Rattle, rattle, rattle

I'm the serpent
Devil's servant
Time to meet your end
Fangs are ready for the strike
Deadly razor sharp
Poison with a single spike
When you're immobile
Screaming like a maniac after my attack
Crying like a baby child in exile
Sweat drips out of every pore as
I bite you more and more and more and
Take one last look at your captor
And hear my tail rattling 'til your death
Rattling 'til your death

Trepidation
Don't fear nothing
Snake is bluffing
Whips his tail
Sends you running

Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake

Meet me glassy-eyed, blind, and divine
Hold down the fort on the coastline
The castle is a pimple on the face of our orb
A humble spot for clues to drop if you eavesdrop

I see through the bricks to the sea, crumbling castle
Water's rising up, thick and green, crumbling castle
Inching closer each century, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our citadel?

Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
You would not believe where I'm from, crumbling castle

We wait for the death; that does not come, crumbling castle
Dug all the holes in God's Acre, crumbling castle
We have even said our last rites, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our holding cell?

Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
We head to our extinction, crumbling castle

The sounds of the constant lightning
Would be enough to block out
The thought of the end of the world
If it were not for our tinnitus from the bomb

In the wind, I sway back and forth
I'm brittle as an aged human being
Where my walls are safe from wild weather
The filth forms into great nastiness
Polygondwanaland

I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle

I don't want to fall into dust
I don't want nothing but to live on
The ache inside my keep spurs me on
I don't want to be invisible
Polygondwanaland

I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle

On this very day, in one thousand years
The earth will be relative to the sun and the moon
And a new world will be created
I know because it is written here

I see through the bricks to the sea, crumbling castle
Inching closer each century, crumbling castle
Water's rising up, thick and green, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our citadel?

Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
You would not believe where I'm from, crumbling castle

I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle"

Life is a waterfall
We're one in the river and one again after the fall
Swimming through the void, we hear the word

We drink from the river, then we turn around and put up our walls
Swimming through the void, we hear the word

Got a super-dred bet with an angel drughead
Like a deadbeat winner, I wanna be a sinner
An idolized bang for the industry killer
A hideous man that you don't understand
Throw a suicide party, and I'm guaranteed to fucking snap

Everybody's so completely sure of what we are
Everybody defamates from miles away
But face to face, they haven't got a thing to say
I bleed for this, and I bleed for you
Still, you look in my face like I'm somebody new
Toy, nobody wants anything I've got
Which is fine because you're made of everything I'm not

All the money in the world can't buy me
Go ahead, lie to me
Tell me again how you're tortured
I wanna know how you followed your orders so well
You're full of shit, you had a dream, but this ain't it

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
If the pain goes on, ah

I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited as my time's elapsed
Now all I do is live with so much fate
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact
You cannot kill what you did not create
I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it

Put me back together or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone
Tell me the reality is better than the dream
But I found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside

What a day to meet the master
I've been waiting for so long
Final day to meet the master
It's my time to go home

And I'm taken, woah
By the madness
And the tripping
And the touching

What a day to travel faster
Take my trip around the sun
I have known no other master
He has been the only one

Ooh, he was the only one
Ooh, the only one

And I'm taken
By the madness
And the tripping
And the touching

Ooh, hey

(One, two, three, four)

Well, you're so pretty and I love you so
You know I'm your biggest fan
I saw your picture and it's the best
The finest in the land

Camera, lights, and action
Yeah, the words you know so well
You're in and out of fashion
In Hollywood of Hell

When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all, no

Well, I love you in that movie show
Can I have your autograph?
It's so funny you have such charm
The whole thing made me laugh

Obetrol and cocktails
You're counting all your rings
They all said they loved you
Didn't they, darling?
Well, they've taken all your things

When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all, no

Well, listen, darling
It's been real swell
What can I say?
You've got it all
You're a one woman show
But I'm not gonna lie to you
You could use a little work
Well, at your age
Well

What you got, baby?

When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all

Goodbye, baby
Goodbye"

Many long years amongst the trees
Many long years in the ground
To be with one that's never seen
The one that stands and watches over

I wonder when we'll realize
This is what we got left
And it's our demise
With the water rising
And the air so thin
Still the children smiling
Can we see no sin?

This is what we all have seen
Too many years tearing down
Even though we couldn't believe
It's only clearer in a mirror now

I wonder when we'll realize
This is what we got left
And it's our demise
With the water rising
And the air so thin
Still the children smiling
Can we see no sin?

See no sin
Say no sin

Look, he's crawling up my wall
Black and hairy, very small
Now he's up above my head
Hanging by a little thread

Now he's dropped on to the floor
Heading for the bedroom door
Maybe he's as scared as me
Where's he gone now? I can't see

There he is, wrapped in a ball
Doesn't seem to move at all
Perhaps he's dead, I'll just make sure
Pick this book up off the floor

Boris the spider

Creepy, crawly, creepy, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly

He's come to a sticky end (Creepy, crawly)
Don't think he will ever mend (Creepy, crawly)
Never more will he crawl 'round (Creepy, crawly)
He's embedded in the ground (Creepy, crawly)

Ever since I was a young boy, I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must've played 'em all
But I ain't seen nothing like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

How do you think he does it? I don't know!
What makes him so good?

Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see no lights a-flashing, plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him

Even on my favourite table, he can beat my best
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball"

Athena, I had no idea how much I would need her
In peaceful times I hold her close and I feed her
My heart starts palpitating when I think my guess was wrong
But I think I will get along
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
Athena, all I ever want to do is please her
My life has been so settled and she is the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone
But I think I'll  get along
She's just a girl – she's a bomb

Just a girl, just a girl
She's just a girl

Athena, my heart felt like a shattered glass in an acid bath
I felt like one of those flattened ants you find on a crazy path
I would of topped myself to give her time she did not need to ask
Was I a suicidal psychopath?
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
Consumed, there was a beautiful white horse I saw on a dream stage
He had a snake the size of a sewer pipe living in his rib cage
I felt like a pickled priest who was being flambed
You got me requisitioned Blondie
She's just a girl – she's a bomb

I'm happy, I'm ecstatic
Just a girl, just a girl
She's just a girl

Look into the face of a child
Measure how long you smiled
Before the memory claimed
How long would children remain
How long could children remain
Athena, you picked me up by my lapels and screamed ""leave her""
It felt like waking up in heaven on an empty meter
And now you are stuck with a castrated leader
And I hate the creep, I didn't mean that

She's a bomb
I just said it
She is a bomb
I didn't mean it, please
She's a bomb

Athena, I had no idea how much I need her
My life has been so settled and she is the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone
But I get along
She's just a girl, she's a bomb"

Lives in this yellow house
Yesterday she passed me by
She doesn't wanna know me now

Full of lies and hate
I seemed to scare him a little
So he showed me to the golden gate
