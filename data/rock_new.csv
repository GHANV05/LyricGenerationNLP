Nobody's gonna slow me down

Nobody's gonna mess me around

Once upon a time, not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love

She says, ""We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot""

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
""Baby, it's okay
Someday""

We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer, livin' on a prayer

Just a small-town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night

Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Up and down the boulevard

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows"

You called me strong, you called me weak
But still, your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me, then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?

And if I claim to be a wise man, well

Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

Though his mind is not for rent
Don't put him down as arrogant
His reserve a quiet defense

Is what you say about society
Catch the mist
Catch the myth
Catch the mystery

Love and life are deep
Maybe as his skies are wide

And the space he invades, he gets by on you


No, his mind is not for rent
To any god or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent
He knows changes aren't permanent
But change is

And what you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the witness
Catch the wit
Catch the spirit
Catch the spit

The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his eyes are wide

Exit the warrior

And the energy you trade
He gets right on to

Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red, out of her head, she sang
Do do do do do do dododo
Do do do do do do dododo
Do do do do do do do do
Do do dododo

Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow, how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head, out of her head, she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
Do do do do do do dododo
Do do do do do do dododo
Do do do do do do do do
Do do dododo

Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now, I know you've always been
Out of your head, out of my head, I sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
So, dad would take the Sundays off
And that's the only time he could ever get any rest
And so, because we were loud on Sundays
He'd make us hold his construction boots over our head, 'til we'd sleep
And they were really heavy boots and I used to say, ""Dad, come on, please""
And like start crying, 'cause they're too heavy

And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when"

Saçım da soğuk bir rüzgar
Colitaların ılık kokusu
Gökyüzüne yükseliyor
Uzakta bir yerde
Parlak bir ışık gördüm
Kafam ağırlaştı ve görüşüm bulanıklaştı
Gece için durmam gerekti



Orda kapı yolunda duruyordu
Görev zilini duydum
Ve kendi kendime düşündüm

'Bu cennette olabilir, cehennem de'
Sonra kız bir mum yaktı
Ve bana yolu gösterdi
Koridorda sesler vardı
Sanırım şöyle dediklerini duydum



Hotel California'ya hoşgeldiniz
Çok sevimli bir yer (Çok sevimli bir yer)
Çok sevimli bir yüz
Hotel California'da çokça oda var
Senenin herhangi bir zamanı (senenin herhangi bir zamanı)
Burda bulabilirsin



Onun aklı mücеvherlerde
Onun Mеrcedes bends'i var
Arkadaş diye çağırdığı
Bir sürü tatlı erkek arkadaşları var
Sahne de nasıl dans ediyorlar
Tatlı yaz terinde
Bazı danslar hatırlanmak içindir
Bazı danslar unutmak



Kaptana seslendim
""Lütfen bana şarabımı getir""
""Biz de 1969'dan beri o içki yok"" dedi
Ve hala o sesler çok uzaklardan çağırıyor
Seni gecenin ortasında uyandırır
Sadece şunu duyman için



Hotel California'ya hoşgeldiniz
Çok sevimli bir yer (Çok sevimli bir yer)
Çok sevimli bir yüz
Hotel California'da yaşıyorlar
Ne güzel bir süpriz (ne güzel bir süpriz)
Bahanelerinizi getirin



Tavan da aynalar
Buzda büyük pembe şampanya
Ve o dedi ki ""Burada hepimiz sadece kendimizin tutsağız""
Ve ana salonda
Ziyafet için toplandılar
Onu çelik bıçaklarıyla doğradılar
Ama canavarı öldüremezler



Hatırladığım son şey
Kapıya koşutuğumdu
Daha önce olduğum yere giden
Geçidi tekrar bulmalıydım
""Sakinleş"" dedi adam
Varmak için programlandık
""İstediğin zaman çıkış yapabilirsin
Ama asla ayrılamazsın"""

Jessie is a friend
Yeah, I know, he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl, and I wanna make her mine

And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body
I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?

I'll play along with this charade
That doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her, but the point is probably moot

'Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body
I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?
Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman...
Where can I find a woman like that?

And I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
Wonderin' what she don't see in me
I've been funny; I've been cool with the lines
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?

Tell me where can I find a woman like that?


You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl

Where can I find a woman like that?

And you don't know just how a woman feels

You didn't know what rock and roll was
Until you met my drummer on a grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line

Now, it's the middle of the night on the open road
And the heater don't work, and it's oh, so cold
You're looking tired, you're looking kind of beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet

You didn't know how rock and roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group

So, you bought a candle and you lived and you learned

So this ain't the end, I saw you again today
I had to turn my heart away
Smile like the sun, kisses for everyone
And tales, it never fails

You lying so low in the weeds
I bet you gonna ambush me
You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees
Now wouldn't you, Barracuda? Oh


Back over time, we were all trying for free
You met the porpoise and me, uh-huh
No right, no wrong, selling a song, a name
Whisper game

And if the real thing don't do the trick
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick
Ooh, Barracuda, oh, yeah

""Sell me, sell you,"" the porpoise said
Dive down deep now to save my head
You, I think that you got the blues, too
All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools, silly, silly fools

The real thing don't do the trick, no?
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick
Oh, Barra-Barracuda, yeah"

I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
A look from you, and I would fall from grace
And that would wipe the smile right from my face

Do you remember when we used to dance?
And incidents arose from circumstance
One thing led to another, we were young
And we would scream together songs unsung

It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what my heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

And now you find yourself in Eighty Two
The disco hot spots hold no charm for you
You can concern yourself with bigger things
You catch a pearl and ride the dragon's wings

'Cause it's the heat of the moment

The heat of the moment showed in your eyes


And when your looks are gone and you're alone
How many nights you sit beside the phone?
What were the things you wanted for yourself?
Teenage ambitions you remember well

It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

It starts with one

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all

You're now a slave until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness turning
Haunting, yearning, pull the trigger!

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare
(While your nightmare comes to life)

Can't wake up in sweat
'Cause it ain't over yet
Still dancin' with your demons
(Victim of your own creation!)
Beyond the will to fight
Where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason
(Loathing self-assassination!)

You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (Feel)
So sedated as they medicate your brain
And while you slowly go insane, they tell ya
""Given with the best intentions
Help you with your complications!""

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call
Everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare, ha-ha-ha-ha


Fight (Fight!)
Not to fail (Fail!)
Not to fall (Fall!)
Or you'll end up like the others
Die (Die!)
Die again (Die!)
Drenched in sin (Sin!)
With no respect for another

Unh!

Down (Down!)
Feel the fire (Fire!)
Feel the hate (Hate!)
Your pain is what we desire
Lost (Lost!)
Hit the wall (Wall!)
Watch you crawl (Crawl!)
Such a replaceable liar

And I know you hear their voices
(Calling from above)
And I know they may seem real
(These signals of love)
But our life's made up of choices
(Some without appeal)
They took for granted your soul
And it's ours now to steal
(As your nightmare comes to life)

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call
Everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare"

It's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?

The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
So give her inches and feed her well
More days to come, new places to go
I've got to leave, it's time for a show

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

My body is burning, it starts to shout
Desire is coming, it breaks out loud
Lust is in cages, till storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose

The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

Ricky was a young boy, he had a heart of stone
Lived 9-to-5 and he worked his fingers to the bone
Just barely out of school, came from the edge of town
Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down, no

He had no money, no, no good at home
Walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone
And now it's

Eighteen and life, you got it
Eighteen and life, you know
Your crime is time and it's eighteen and life to go
Eighteen and life, you got it
Eighteen and life, you know
Your crime is time and it's eighteen and life to go, oh-woah-oh, yes

Tequila in his heartbeat, his veins burned gasoline
It kept his motor runnin' but it never kept him clean
They say he loved adventure, Ricky's the wild one
He married trouble, had a courtship with a gun

Bang-bang, shoot 'em up, the party never ends
You can't think of dying when the bottle's your best friend
And now it's

Eighteen and life, you got it
Eighteen and life, you know
Your crime is time and it's eighteen and life to go

He fired his six-shot to the wind

Swingin' where we want 'cause there ain't nobody home
Swingin' to the left and swingin' to the right
Think about baseball, I'll swing all night, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Swingin' in the living room, swingin' in the kitchen
Most folks don't 'cause they're too busy bitchin'
Swingin' in there 'cause she wanted me to feed her
So I mixed up the batter and she licked the beater

I scream, you scream, we all scream for her
Don't even try 'cause you can't ignore her

She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water, such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good, make a grown man cry
Sweet cherry pie (Oh, yeah)
She's my cherry pie
Put a smile on your face, ten miles wide
Looks so good, bring a tear to your eye
Sweet cherry pie

Swingin' to the drums, swingin' to guitar
Swingin' to the bass in the back of my car
Ain't got money, ain't got no gas
But we'll get where we're goin' if we swing real fast

I scream, you scream, we all scream for her
Don't even try 'cause you can't ignore her

Swingin' in the bathroom, swingin' on the floor
Swingin' so hard, forgot to lock the door
In walked her daddy, standin' six foot four
Said, ""You ain't gonna swing with my daughter no more""

Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say ""Beware, doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags, and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home

When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?""
He said, ""Will you defeat them, your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade""
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?""

Sometimes, I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times, I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, and let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end, we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, ha, ha)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, ha, ha)
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
And give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
Just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
Just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, you'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me

Show me how to lie, you're getting better all the time
And turning all against the one is an art that's hard to teach
Another clever word sets off an unsuspecting herd
And as you step back in the line, a mob jumps to their feet

Now dance, fucker, dance, man, he never had a chance
And no one even knew it was really only you
And now you steal away
Take him out today
Nice work you did
You're gonna go far, kid

With a thousand lies and a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away, nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives

Slowly outta line and drifting closer in your sight
So play it out, I'm wide-awake, it's a scene about me
There's something in your way and now someone is gonna pay
And if you can't get what you want, well, it's all because of me

Now dance, fucker, dance, man, I never had a chance
And no one even knew it was really only you
And now you lead the way
Show the light of day
Nice work you did
You're gonna go far, kid (Trust deceived)

With a thousand lies and a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away, nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives


Now dance, fucker, dance, he never had a chance
And no one even knew it was really only you
And so dance, fucker, dance, I never had a chance
It was really only you

With a thousand lies and a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away, nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives
Clever alibis, Lord of the Flies
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away, nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives"

They were askin' if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were livin' downtown

Every night, she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she's got
Man, when I tell ya she was cool, she was red hot
I mean she was steamin'
And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place

Down at Dino's bar and grill
The drink will flow and blood will spill
And if the boys wanna fight, you better let 'em

Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
When I was feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
That rode us all the way in to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', don't mean nothin', honey, if it ain't free, no no
Yeah, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
You know feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun
Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', and that's all that Bobby left me
Well feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
Hey feelin' good was good enough for me, mhm
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

Well, I remember every little thing as if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake and there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school, they were wishing they were me that night

And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon! Hold on tight!
Well, c'mon! Hold on tight!

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light

Ain't no doubt about it, we were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen and we were barely dressed
Ain't no doubt about it, baby got to go and shout it
Ain't no doubt about it, we were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen and we were barely dressed

Baby, don'tcha hear my heart? You got it drowning out the radio
I've been waiting so long for you to come along and have some fun
And I gotta let you know, no, you never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes, I got a big surprise, it'll feel all right
Well, I wanna make your motor run

And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon! Hold on tight!
Well, c'mon! Hold on tight!

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light
Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
Paradise by the dashboard light

You got to do what you can
And let Mother Nature do the rest
Ain't no doubt about it, we were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen and we were barely-

We're gonna go all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way and tonight's the night
We're gonna go all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way and tonight's the night
We're gonna go all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way and tonight's the night
We're gonna go all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way and tonight's the night

OK, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker going here
Two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth
There's the windup, and there it is, a line shot up the middle
Look at him go. This boy can really fly!
He's rounding first and really turning it on now
He's not letting up at all, he's gonna try for Second
The ball is bobbled out in center, and here comes the throw
And what a throw! He's gonna slide in head first
Here he comes, he's out! No, wait, safe - safe at second base
This kid really makes things happen out there
Batter steps up to the plate, here's the pitch-he's going
And what a jump he's got. He's trying for third, here's the throw
It's in the dirt-safe at third! Holy cow, stolen base!
He's taking a pretty big lead out there
Almost daring him to try and pick him off
The pitcher glances over, winds up, and it's bunted
Bunted down the third base line, the suicide squeeze is on!
Here he comes, squeeze play, it's gonna be close, here's the throw, here's the play at the plate
Holy cow, I think he's gonna make it!

Stop right there! I gotta know right now
Before we go any further, do you love me?
Will you love me forever? Do you need me?
Will you never leave me?
Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life?
Will you take me away and will you make me your wife?

Let me sleep on it (Will you love me forever?)
Let me sleep on it (Will you love me forever?)

I couldn't take it any longer, Lord I was crazed
And when the feeling came upon me like a tidal wave
Started swearing to my God and on my mother's grave
That I would love you to the end of time
I swore that I would love you to the end of time!
So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time, it's all that I can do
Praying for the end of time so I can end my time with you!

Sometimes I feel the fear of
Uncertainty stinging clear
And I, I can't help but ask myself
How much I let the fear take the wheel and steer
It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague
Haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
Should be the one behind the wheel

Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there, yeah, ohh

So if I decide to waiver my
Chance to be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive?
Ohh-oh-ohh

It's driven me before, and it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I'm beginning to find that
When I drive myself my light is found

And whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there, yeah, ohh


Would you choose the water over wine
Hold the wheel and drive?

Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there

I can't give you back what's been hurt
Heartaches come and go
And all that's left are the words

And it ain't easy to get back, takes so long

I can't clear my heart of your love
It falls like rain, ain't the same
I hear you calling far away
Tearing through my soul
I just can't take another day

About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt

So shave your face with some mace in the dark

The forces of evil and a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat, for the body, for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax fallin' on a termite
Who's chokin' on the splinters

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me? (Get crazy with the cheese whiz)

You know I like my girls a little bit older

And I don't wanna lose your love tonight

I ain't got many friends left to talk to
Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you
Stay the night but keep it undercover

I just wanna use your love tonight, oh
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

Try to stop my hands from shakin'
'Cause somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense
It's been awhile since we were all alone
I can't hide the way I'm feelin'

As you’re leaving, please, would you close the door?
And don't forget what I told ya:
Just 'cause you're right, that don't mean I'm wrong

Ah, shit

Oh, oh

Drowning deep in my sea of loathing
Broken your servant, I kneel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems what's left of my human side
Is slowly changing in me
(Will you give in to me?)

Looking at my own reflection
When suddenly it changes, violently it changes (Oh)
No, there is no turning back now
You've woken up the demon in me

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me

I can see inside you, the sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems that all that was good has died
And is decaying in me
(Will you give in to me?)

It seems you're having some trouble
In dealing with these changes, living with these changes (Oh)
No, the world is a scary place
Now that you've woken up the demon in me

I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she living, she golden
She lives for me, says she lives for the ovation
Her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I'll make you smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give 'em the games she play, she say

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose, I was taking sips of it to my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now, I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that filthy dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
Slides up around the belly face down on the mattress one
And you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself, head made of the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

And I want something else
To get me through this life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one

And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)

But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Don't break no hearts; hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo), hey-ey

We're runnin' in circles again
Just as things were lookin' up, you said it wasn't good enough
But still, we're tryin' one more time

Maybe we're just tryin' too hard
When really, it's closer than it is too far

'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep

Because I'm bendin' over backwards to relate
It's one thing to complain, but when you're drivin' me insane
Well then I think it's time that we took a break

Maybe we're just tryin' too hard

And I hate it when you fake it
You can't hide it, you might as well embrace it
So believe me, it's not easy
It seems that something's telling me

Please come now, I think I'm falling
I'm holding on to all I think is safe
It seems I found the road to nowhere
And I'm trying to escape
I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it, let me say
Let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
""Maybe six feet ain't so far down""

I'm looking down, now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace
I cried out ""Heaven save me""
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it, let me say
Let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
""Maybe six feet ain't so far down""
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
""Maybe six feet ain't so far down""
I'm so far down

Sad eyes follow me
But I still believe there's something left for me
So please, come stay with me
'Cause I still believe there's something left for you and me
For you and me, for you and me

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking

Hold me now

I was down at the New Amsterdam
Staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer
You know, she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful

So come dance this silence down through the morning
Sha-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah
Cut up, Maria
Show me some of them Spanish dances and
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
'Cause I wanna be someone who believes
Yeah

Mr. Jones and me
Tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at them beautiful women
She's looking at you
Oh no, no, she's looking at me
Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you
You can never be lonely

Well, I'm gon' paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red, and black, and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me
Look into the future
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's looking at you
I don't think so, she's looking at me
Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me
I will never be lonely

I will never be lonely
Said, I'm never gonna be lonely

I wanna be a lion
Yeah, everybody wanna pass as cats
We all wanna be big, big stars
Yeah, but we got different reasons for that
Believe in me
'Cause I don't believe in anything
And I, I wanna be someone to believe
To believe, to believe, yeah

Mr. Jones and me
Stumbling through the barrio
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's perfect for you
Man, there's got to be somebody for me
I wanna be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone
Just a little more funky
When everybody loves you
Oh son, that's just about as funky as you can be
Mr. Jones and me
Staring at the video
When I look at the television, I wanna see me
Staring right back at me
We all wanna be big stars
But we don't know why and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me
I wanna be just about as happy as I can be

Hey, dad, look at me
Think back and talk to me
Did I grow up according to plan?
And do you think I'm wasting my time
Doing things I wanna do?
But it hurts when you disapprove all along

And now I try hard to make it
I just wanna make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
Can't pretend that I'm alright
And you can't change me

'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever

And we can't go back

I try not to think
About the pain I feel inside
Did you know you used to be my hero?
All the days you spent with me
Now seem so far away
And it feels like you don't care anymore

And now I try hard to make it
I just wanna make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
I can't stand another fight
And nothing's alright

And nothing's gonna make this right again (Right again)

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
If the pain goes on, ah

I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited as my time's elapsed
Now all I do is live with so much fate
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact
You cannot kill what you did not create
I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it

Put me back together or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone
Tell me the reality is better than the dream
But I found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you (Crawlin' back to you)
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few? (Had a few)
'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too busy)

Going with the flow, it's all a game to me

Double up or quit, double stake or split

But that's the way I like it, baby, I don't wanna live forever
And don't forget the joker


Pushing up the ante, I know you got to see me
Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again
I see it in your eyes, take one look and die
The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company

As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

After having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

But happy times together we've been spending

Looking back at me I see that I never really got it right
I never stopped to think of you
I'm always wrapped up in things I cannot win
You are the antidote that gets me by
Something strong like a drug that gets me high

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold
What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so

Cold to you I'm sorry 'bout all the lies
Maybe in a different light
You could see me stand on my own again
Cause now I can see
You were the antidote that got me by
Something strong like a drug that got me high

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold
What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold

I never meant to be so cold
(Gtr Solo)

I never really wanted you to see
The screwed up side of me that I keep
Locked inside of me so deep
It always seems to get to me
I never really wanted you to go
So many things you should have known
I guess for me there's just no hope
I never meant to be so cold

What I really meant to say (Say)
Is I'm sorry for the way I am (Is I'm sorry for the way)
I never meant to be so cold (I am)
Never meant to be so cold
What I really meant to say (Say)
Is I'm sorry for the way I am (Is I'm sorry for the way)

It kills me not to know this, but I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were and her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down, a single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face, that this world has forgotten

There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true when I'm constantly failing you
Walls that we just can't break through until we disappear

So, tell me now
If this ain't love, then how do we get out?
’Cause I don't know

That's when she said, ""I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!""
(Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, ""I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!""
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!

And the day pressed on like crushing weights, for no man does it ever wait
Like memories of dying days that deafen us like hurricanes
Bathed in flames we held the brand, uncurled the fingers in your hand
Pressed into the flesh like sand, now do you understand?

So, tell me now
If this ain't love, then how do we get out?
’Cause I don't know

That's when she said, ""I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!""
(Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, ""I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!""
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!

One thousand miles away, there's nothing left to say
But so much left that I don't know
We never had a choice, this world is too much noise
It takes me under, it takes me under once again...

I don't hate you...
I don't hate you, no...

So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know

That's when she said, ""I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!""
(Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, ""I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer

Honey, why you callin' me so late?
It’s kinda hard to talk right now
Honey, why you cryin'? Is everything okay?
I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud

Oh, well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It’s really good to hear your voice
Sayin' my name, it sounds so sweet
Comin' from the lips of an angel
Hearin' those words, it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It‘s funny that you're callin' me tonight
And yes, I've dreamt of you too
Does he know you're talkin' to me
Will it start a fight?
No, I don't think she has a clue

Oh, well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It’s really good to hear your voice
Sayin' my name, it sounds so sweet
Comin' from the lips of an angel
Hearin' those words, it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful

That David played, and it pleased the Lord

The baffled king composing ""Hallelujah""

Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Well, baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah


Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hey, hey, hey, hey

Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out and
Love's strange, so real in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

Will you stand above me?
Look my way, never love me
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down, down
Will you recognize me?
Call my name or walk on by
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down, down, down

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh, whoa

Don't you try and pretend
It's my feeling we'll win in the end
I won't harm you or touch your defenses
Vanity, insecurity, ah
Don't you forget about me
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
Goin' to take you apart
I'll put us back together at heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

Waitin' on a Sunday afternoon
For what I've read between the lines

Feelin' like a hand in rusted shame
So do you laugh or does it cry?
Reply?

Only yesterday you lied
Promises of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time go by
All of these things you said to me

Breathin' is the hardest thing to do
With all I've said and all that's dead for you
You lied, goodbye

Or recognize my face
Say you don't care who goes
To that kind of place
Knee deep in the hoopla
Sinking in your fight
Too many runaways
Eating up the night

Who cares? They're always changing

We just want to dance here
Someone stole the stage
They call us irresponsible
Write us off the page

In a tired old street
Police have got the chokehold, oh
Then we just lost the beat

Who counts the money
Underneath the bar
Who rides the wrecking ball
Into our guitars
Don't tell us you need us
'Cause we're the ship of fools
Looking for America
Coming through your schools

I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge
On another gorgeous sunny Saturday
And I'm seeing that bumper to bumper traffic
Don't you remember? ('Member, 'member)
It's your favorite radio station
In your favorite radio city
The city by the bay, the city that rocks
The city that never sleeps

Wasn't me she was foolin'

And I know love was here to stay
When she told me to

Schoolgirl sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up the knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss
Like this

Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singing, hey diddle diddle
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to

Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
Just give me a kiss

Standin' in the rain, with his head hung low
Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold-out show
Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene
Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream
He heard one guitar, just blew him away
He saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day

Bought a beat-up six-string in a secondhand store
Didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure
That one guitar felt good in his hands
Didn't take long to understand
Just one guitar, slung way down low
Was a one-way ticket, only one way to go

So he started rockin'
Ain't never gonna stop
Gotta keep on rockin'
Someday gonna make it to the top

And be a juke box hero, (Got stars in his eyes)
He's a juke box hero
He took one guitar, (Juke box hero, stars in his eyes)
Juke box hero, (Stars in his eyes), he'll come alive tonight

In a town without a name, in a heavy downpour
Thought he passed his own shadow, by the backstage door
Like a trip through the past, to that day in the rain
And that one guitar made his whole life change

Now he needs to keep a-rockin'
He just can't stop
Gotta keep on rockin'
That boy has got to stay on top

And be a juke box hero, (Got stars in his eyes)
He's a juke box hero, (Got stars in his eyes)
Yeah, juke box hero, (Stars in his eyes)
With that one guitar (Stars in his eyes)
He'll come alive
Come alive tonight


Yeah, he's gotta keep a-rockin'
He just can't stop

And be a juke box hero, (Got stars in his eyes)

Was the summer of '69

Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
Should've known we'd never get far

Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life
Hey!

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh, yeah
Back in the summer of '69, oh

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothing can last forever
Forever, no!
Yeah!

Yeah!

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
Think about you, wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

On every shore
And I'll try, oh Lord I'll try

Reflections in the waves spark my memory
Some happy, some sad
I think of childhood friends, and the dreams we had

We lived happily forever
So the story goes
But somehow we missed out
On the pot of gold
But we'll try best that we can
To carry on

Appeared above my head
They sang to me this song of hope
And this is what they said

Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication

It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication

Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station??
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there, and I don't mean on vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication


Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication"

Watch your tongue or have it cut from your head
Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid
Children roam the streets, now orphans of war
Bodies hangin' in the streets to adore

Royal flames will carve a path in chaos
Bringing daylight to the night
Death is riding into town with armor
They've come to take all your rights

Hail to the king
Hail to the one
Kneel to the crown
Stand in the sun
Hail to the king
(Hail! Hail! Hail)
The king

Blood is spilt while holding keys to the throne
Born again, but it’s too late to atone
No mercy from the edge of the blade
Dare escape, and learn the price to be paid

Let the water flow with shades of red now
Arrows black out all the light
Death is riding into town with armor
They've come to grant you your rights

Hail to the king
Hail to the one
Kneel to the crown
Stand in the sun
Hail to the king
(Hail! Hail! Hail!)

There's a taste of fear
(Hail! Hail! Hail!)
When the henchmen call
(Hail! Hail! Hail!)
Iron fist to tame the land
(Hail! Hail! Hail!)
Iron fist to claim it all

Crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see

Nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky

It's all relative to the size of your steeple
You can't see the forest for the trees
And you can't smell your own shit on your knees

There's no time to discriminate
Hate every motherfucker that's in your way

Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
If you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean
(Ah, ah)

The worms will live in every host
It's hard to pick which one they hate the most
The horrible people, the horrible people
It's all anatomic as the size of your steeple
Capitalism has made it this way
Old-fashioned fascism will take it away

Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
If you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean

There's no time to discriminate
Hate every motherfucker that's in your way

Waking from the dead of night

Then when he's found who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save

Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Hey yeah, bark at the Moon

They cursed and buried him along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone, gone
In empty burning hell, unholy one
But he's returned to prove them wrong, so wrong
Ooh, yeah, baby

Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell

Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary, it sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cat's in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
Is there any just 'cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times

Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over, the moment has gone
I followed my hands, not my head, I know I was wrong

Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell
Go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by, they would stop and say
""Oh, my, but that little country boy could play""
Go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Johnny B. Goode


His mother told him, ""Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Sayin' 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'""

The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling; that's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
Power of love that keeps you home at night

It don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love

First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it, it might make you mad
But you'll be glad, baby, when you've found
That's the power, makes the world go 'round

And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

They say that all in love is fair
Yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Can you feel it?
Hmm-mm, hmm


It don't take money and it don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train

Everybody say, ""I'm cool"" (He's cool)
I can't complain, but sometimes I still do
Life's been good to me so far


I go to parties, sometimes until four
It's hard to leave when you can't find the door
It's tough to handle this fortune and fame
Everybody's so different, I haven't changed

They say I'm lazy, but it takes all my time
Everybody say, ""Oh, yeah"" (Oh, yeah)
I keep on goin', guess I'll never know why
Life's been good to me so far
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh oh, here comes a flock of wah-wahs
(Wah-wah, wah-wah...)"

Mississippi queen
If you know what I mean
Mississippi queen
She taught me everything

Way down around Vicksburg
Around Louisiana way
Lived a Cajun lady
They called her Mississippi Queen

You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine
While the rest of them dudes were getting their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was getting mine

Mississippi queen
If you know what I mean
Mississippi queen
She taught me everything

This lady she asked me
If I would be her man
You know that I told her
I'd do what I can

To keep her looking pretty
Buy her dresses that shine
While the rest of them dudes were making their bread
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was losing mine


You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine
While the rest of them dudes were getting their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was getting mine

Hey, Mississippi queen"

I have climbed highest mountain
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing fingertips
It burned like fire
This burnin' desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for

I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still runnin'
You broke the bonds and you loosened the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believe it

But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for"

I can't begin to know when
But then I know it's growin' strong
Was in the spring
And spring became the summer
Who'd have believed you'd come along?

Hands, touchin' hands
Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you

Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would
But now I…

Look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two
And when I hurt
Hurtin' runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when holdin' you?

One, touchin' one
Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you

Oh no, no

Oh, woah, woah, oh

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend (Shoulda known better, yeah)
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

Never without your love


Tonight, the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh


(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone) Was what I did so wrong, so wrong
That you had to leave me alone?"

Ooh, yeah

I did my time, and I want out
So effusive, fade, it doesn't cut, the soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion, pseudo-sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done, it has begun, I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

There are cracks in the road we laid
But where the temple fell, the secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had
Who needs another mess? We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness, venomous, insipid
I think we're done, I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Sitting on a park bench
Eying little girls with bad intent
Snot running down his nose
Greasy fingers smearing shabby clo-othes
Hey, Aqualung!
Drying in the cold sun
Watching as the frilly panties run
Hey, Aqualung!
Feeling like a dead duck
Spitting out pieces of his broken luck
Whoa, Aqualung

Sun streaking cold
An old man wandering lonely
Taking time the only way he knows
Leg hurting bad
As he bends to pick a dog-end
He goes down to the bog, and warms his feet
Feeling alone
The army’s up the road
Salvation à la mode, and a cup of tea
Aqualung, my friend
Don’t you start away uneasy
You poor old sod, you see, it’s only me

Do you still remember
December’s foggy freeze?
When the ice that clings on to your beard was screaming agony
(Hey!)
And you snatch your rattling last breaths
With deep-sea–diver sounds
And the flowers bloom like madness in the spring

Sun streaking cold
An old man wandering lonely
Taking time the only way he knows
Leg hurting bad
As he bends to pick a dog-end
He goes down to the bog and warms his feet
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Salvation a la mode and a cup of tea

Can't I take away all this pain? (You wanna see the light)

Sometimes, it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes, I cannot feel my face

Feeling like I have no release (So do I)
How many times have I felt diseased? (You wanna see the light)
Nothing in my life is free, is free

In the dumps with the mumps
As the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older
I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin'
The calliope crashed to the ground

The calliope crashed to the ground!

And go-kart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart
To see if it was safe outside
And little Early-Pearly came by in his curly-wurly
And asked me if I needed a ride

Asked me if I needed a ride!

Mama always told me not to look into the eyes of the sun
But mama, that's where the fun is

Preacher from the east
Says, ""Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in it's funny bone
That's where they expect it least""
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner
Watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone
Was messin' with his frozen zone reminding him of romance

It's all the same, only the names will change
Every day it seems we're wastin' away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home

I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive

Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone, well, all you do is think

I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
Wanted (Wanted) dead or alive

Oh, and I ride


Ooh, I'm a cowboy

I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive

But I walk these streets, a loaded six-string on my back
I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back
I've been everywhere, (Oh yeah) still I'm standin' tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all

'Cause I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse, I ride

You're telling me things, but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me because the rabbit done died, yes, it did

...Congressional reports
President Ford says that he's disappointed
With Congress's performance
In Detroit, a Pontiac, Michigan youth
Was reported dead at the scene of
A head-on collision on Grand Avenue this morning
He was reportedly driving on the wrong side of the boulevard When he struck a delivery truck
And was catapulted through the windshield of his car
The driver of the truck is reported to be uninjured
The identities of both men are being withheld by local police
County legislatures today are expected to rally
To the aid of striking longshoremen
In hopes of ending the nine-month deadlock...
""..Roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day...""

I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine o'clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song, and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do
I got to

Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!

Getting late, I just can't wait
Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink, then I smoke
Start the car and I try to make the midnight show

Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat


Moving fast, down 95
Hit top speed, but I'm still moving much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive

There's a truck ahead, lights staring at my eyes

Nobody on the road

Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow and
Smiling at everyone
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone


Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
“Don't look back, you can never look back”
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the
Radio on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and those
Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong

Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall

Cast my memory back there, Lord

Making love in the green grass

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk a—

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beatin'
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then, I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walkin' down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk a—

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beatin'
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then, I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone, and I walk a—

I miss you, I miss you

Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

I miss you, miss you
I miss you, miss you

Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stared, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)


Don't waste your time on me, you're already

Stand alone, stand alone...

You're always hiding behind
Your so-called goddess
So, what? You don't think
That we can see your face?
Resurrected back before
The final falling
I'll never rest until
I can make my own way

I'm not afraid of fading...

I stand alone
Feeling your sting down inside me
I'm not dying for it

And now it's my time (Now it's my time)
It's my time to dream (It's my time to dream)

Make me believe that this place
Isn't plagued by the poison in me
And help me decide if my fire will burn out
Before you can breathe
Breathe into me

Wake up Maggie, I think I got somethin' to say to you
It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used

Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone

You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

The morning sun, when it's in your face, really shows your age
But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax

Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone

You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover and mother, what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head

Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone

You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried


I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock and roll band
That needs a helpin' hand

Oh Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway


Maggie! I wished I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home, one of these days

Don't know what I want, but I know how to get it

Anarchy for the U.K., it's coming sometime and maybe
I give a wrong time, stop at traffic line
Your future dream is a shopping scheme

'Cause I, I wanna be anarchy
In the city

How many ways to get what you want
I use the best, I use the rest
I use the enemy
I use anarchy

'Cause I wanna be anarchy
It's the only way to be


Is this the M.P.L.A.?
Or is this the U.D.A.?
Or is this the I.R.A.?
I thought it was the U.K.
Or just another country
Another council tenancy

And I wanna be anarchy

And I wanna be anarchist

Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drum


Oh, mothers, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Living on a lighted stage
Approaches the unreal
For those who think and feel
In touch with some reality
Beyond the gilded cage

Cast in this unlikely role
Ill-equipped to act
With insufficient tact
One must put up barriers
To keep oneself intact

Living in the limelight
The universal dream
For those who wish to seem
Those who wish to be
Must put aside the alienation
Get on with the fascination
The real relation
The underlying theme

Living in a fisheye lens
Caught in the camera eye
I have no heart to lie
I can't pretend a stranger
Is a long-awaited friend

All the world's indeed a stage
And we are merely players
Performers and portrayers
Each another's audience
Outside the gilded cage

Must put aside the alienation
Get on with the fascination

By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we wanna go

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone


And on, I read until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone"

Son of a gun

You walked into the party like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror, as you watched yourself gavotte

And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner
They'd be your partner and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you?

You had me several years ago when I was still quite naive
Well, you said that we made such a pretty pair and that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me

I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you? Don't you?


I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you?

Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga
And your horse naturally won
Then you flew your Learjet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun
Well, you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not

You're with some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
Wife of a close friend and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you? Don't you now?

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you"

Oh, I miss the misery

I've been a mess since you stayed
I've been a wreck since you changed
Don't let me get in your way
I miss the lies and the pain
The fights that keep us awake-ake-ake
I'm tellin' you

I miss the bad things, the way you hate me
I miss the screamin', the way that you blame me
Miss the phone calls when it's your fault
I miss the late nights, don't miss you at all
I like the kick in the face
And the things you do to me
I love the way that it hurts
I don't miss you, I miss the misery

I've tried but I just can't take it
I'd rather fight than just fake it ('Cause I like it rough)
You know that I've had enough
I dare you to call my bluff
Can't take too much of a good thi-ing
I'm tellin' you

I miss the bad things, the way you hate me
I miss the screamin', the way that you blame me
Miss the phone calls when it's your fault
I miss the late nights, don't miss you at all
I like the kick in the face
And the things you do to me
I love the way that it hurts
I don't miss you, I miss the misery

Just know that I'll make you hurt
I miss the lies and the pain, what you did to me
When you tell me, you'll make it worse
I'd rather fight all night than watch the TV
I hate that feelin' inside
You tell me how hard you'll try
But when we're at our worst
I miss the misery

I miss the bad things, the way you hate me
I miss the screamin', the way that you blame me
I miss the rough sex, leaves me a mess
I miss the feeling of pains in my chest
Miss the phone calls when it's your fault
I miss the late nights, don't miss you at all
I like the kick in the face
And the things you do to me
I love the way that it hurts
I don't miss you, I miss the misery

I don't miss you, I miss the misery
I don't miss you, I miss the misery"

'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony that's life

Where all the veins meet, yeah

Well I've never prayed, but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now

Hey, I'm feeling tired
My time has gone today
You flirt with suicide
Sometimes that's okay
Do what others say
I'm here standing hollow
Falling away from me

That's when I'm insane

""It's gonna be better tomorrow""

Beating me, beating me

You're wondering who I am (Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
Machine or mannequin (Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
With parts made in Japan (Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
I am the Modren Man
I've got a secret I've been hiding under my skin
My heart is human, my blood is boiling, my brain IBM
So if you see me acting strangely, don't be surprised
I'm just a man who needed someone and somewhere to hide
To keep me alive, just keep me alive
Somewhere to hide to keep me alive

I'm not a robot without emotions, I'm not what you see
I've come to help you with your problems, so we can be free
I'm not a hero, I'm not a savior, forget what you know
I'm just a man whose circumstances went beyond his control
Beyond my control, we all need control
I need control, we all need control

I am the Modern Man (Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
Who hides behind a mask (Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
So no one else can see (Secret, secret, I've got a secret)

If it feels alright
Maybe you can stay all night
Shall I leave you my key?

But you've got to give me a sign
Come on girl, some kind of sign
Tell me, are you hot mama?
You sure look that way to me

Are you old enough?
Will you be ready when I call you bluff?
Is my timing right?
Did you save your love for me tonight?

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah

Nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah

Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame

So, never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

(You're not the only one, you're not the only one)
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one

I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feelin' right
We started makin' out, and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?


And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
(What's my age again?)
(What's my age again?)
That's about the time that she broke up with me
(Please stay with me)
No one should take themselves so seriously
(Please stay with me)
With many years ahead to fall in line
(Please stay with me)
Why would you wish that on me?
(Please stay) I never wanna act my age
(With) What's my age again?

Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been ""when it's right, it's right""
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night?

When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway

Thinking of you's working up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbing sticks and stones together, make the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbing you is getting so exciting

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Started out this morning feeling so polite
I always thought a fish could not be caught who didn't bite
But you got some bait awaiting and I think I might
Like nibbling a little afternoon delight

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Be waiting for me, baby, when I come around
We can make a lot of loving 'fore the sun gone down

Thinking of you's working up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbing sticks and stones together, make the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbing you is getting so exciting

Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends

Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care
Right? Yeah

Now I'll relate this little bit
It happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night, she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score

Oh, I know I should say no
But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb

Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate, break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Through all the cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hills
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down, get back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man

There's no load I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long, hmm
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah)
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long

There was a distance between you and I
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye
Oh


There ain't no load that I can't hold
Road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah)
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long (Yeah, yeah)

And I live in a small town
Probably die in a small town
Oh, those small communities
All my friends are so small town
My parents live in the same small town
My job is so small town
Provides little opportunity
Educated in a small town
Taught to fear Jesus in a small town
Used to daydream in that small town
Another boring romantic, that's me
But I've seen it all in a small town
Had myself a ball in a small town
Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town
Now she's small town just like me
No, I cannot forget from where it is that I come from
I cannot forget the people who love me
Yeah, I can be myself here in this small town
And people let me be just what I want to be
Got nothing against a big town
Still hayseed enough to say, ""look who's in the big town""
But my bed is in a small town
Oh, and that's good enough for me

Well, I was born in a small town
And I can breathe in a small town
Gonna die in this small town
Oh that's probably where they'll bury me"

That's great
It starts with an earthquake, birds and snakes
An aeroplane
And Lenny Bruce is not afraid
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs
Speed it up a knox, speak, grunt, no, strength
The ladders start to clatter with fear fight, down, height
Wire in a fire, representing seven games
And a government for hire and a combat site
Left her and wasn't coming in a hurry with the Furies
Breathing down your neck
Team by team, reporters baffled, trump, tethered, crop
Look at that low plane, fine, then
Uh-oh, overflow, population, common food
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself.
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Tell me with the rapture and the reverent in the right, right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psyched

It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine

Six o'clock, TV hour, don't get caught in foreign tower
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform, book burning, blood letting
Every motive escalate, automotive cinerate
Light a candle, light a votive, step down, step down
Watch your heel crush, crushed, uh-oh, this means
No fear, cavalier renegade steer clear
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives
And I decline

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
And I feel fine (I feel fine)


It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
And I feel fine

The other night I dreamt of knives, continental drift divide
Mountains sit in a line, Leonard Bernstein
Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam but neck
Right? Right

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)

I was a little too tall, could've used a few pounds
Tight pants, points, hardly renowned
She was a black-haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own, sittin' way up high
Way up firm and high
Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues

Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves
In the summertime (Mmm)
In the sweet summertime

We weren't in love, oh no far from it
We weren't searchin’ for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Living by the sword
And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, to the alley, or the trusty woods
I used her, she used me, but neither one cared
We were gettin' our share

Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
Mmm, and it was summertime
Mmm, sweet summertime, summertime
And oh the wonder
Felt the lightning
Yeah, and we waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves
With autumn closin' in
Mmm, night moves (Mmm)
Night moves (Night moves)

So you sit home alone, 'cause there's nothin' left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you

You know she likes the lights at night on the neon Broadway sign
She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find (ooh-ooh)

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway


No one heard a single word you said
They shoulda have seen it in your eyes (seen it in your eyes)
What was goin' around your head

Ooh, she's a little runaway

All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway

Is someone getting the best

Are you gone and on to someone new?

I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best

Has someone taken your faith?

Has someone taken your faith?

Oh, where, oh, where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream that I heard last

Oh, where, oh, where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
There were people standin' all around
Something warm rollin' through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
""Hold me, darling, just a little while""
I held her close, I kissed her, our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
Well, now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life, that night

Oh, where, oh, where can my baby be?

She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good

I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot the deputy

All around in my home town

They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy
But I say

I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff and they say it is a capital offense

Sheriff John Brown always hated me, for what? I don't know
Every time that I plant a seed, he said, ""Kill it before it grows""
He said, ""Kill it before it grows""
I say

I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense

Freedom came my way one day and I started out of town
All of a sudden, I see sheriff John Brown aiming to shoot me down
So I shot, I shot him down
I say

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot the deputy

Reflexes got the better of me
And what is to be must be
Every day, the bucket goes to the well
But one day, the bottom will drop out
Yes, one day, the bottom will drop out

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called ""life""
Electric word, life
It means forever, and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else:
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-All-Right
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, babe
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor)
Whoo

If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see, I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
""Ah, ah,"" is all I heard

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go
Come..

We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for? (What's it all for?)
You better live now
'Fore the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?

I heard a knock upon my door the other day
I opened it to find death staring in my face
The feel of mortal stalking still reverberates
Everywhere I go, I drag this coffin just in case

My body's trembling, sends shivers down my spine
Adrenaline kicks in, shifts into overdrive (Drive)
Your secrets keep you sick, your lies keep you alive
Snake eyes every single time you roll with crooked dice

I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down
The kind of dark that haunts a hundred-year-old house
I wrestle with my thoughts, I shook the hand of doubt
Running from my past, I'm praying: ""Feet, don't fail me now""

I've lost my goddamn mind, it happens all the time
I can't believe I'm actually meant to be here
Trying to consume, the drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery, can't you see?

(I got these questions always running through my head)
(So many things that I would like to understand)
If we are born to die and we all die to live
Then what's the point of living life if it just contradicts?

I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down
The kind of dark that haunts a hundred-year-old house
I wrestle with my thoughts, I shook the hand of doubt
Running from my past, I'm praying: ""Feet, don't fail me now""

I've lost my goddamn mind, it happens all the time
I can't believe I'm actually meant to be here
Trying to consume, the drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery, can't you see?


I've lost myself
You tried to reach me, but you just can't help me
So long, goodbye
You tried to save me, it won't work this time 'cause now

I've lost my fucking mind, and there's no fucking time
I can't believe I'm actually meant to be here
Trying to consume, the drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery, can't you see?

Oh, can't you see?
Can't you see?"

Dare me to jump off of this Jersey bridge
I bet you never had a Friday night like this
Keep it up, keep it up, let's raise our hands
I take a look up at the sky, and I see red
Red for the cancer, red for the wealthy
Red for the drink that's mixed with suicide
Everything red
Please won't you push me for the last time?
Let's scream until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want this anymore
The thought of you's no fuckin' fun
You want a martyr? I'll be one
Because enough's enough, we're done

You told me, ""Think about it,"" well, I did (I did)
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of beggin' for the things that I want
I'm over sleepin' like a dog on the floor

Yeah!

The thing I think I love will surely bring me pain
Intoxication, paranoia, and a lot of fame
Three cheers for throwing up, pubescent drama queen
You make me sick, I make it worse by drinkin' late

Scream, scream, scream, scream
Scream, scream until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want to anymore

You want a martyr? I'll be one

Imagine livin' like a king someday
A single night without a ghost in the walls
And if the bass shakes the earth underground
We'll start a new revolution now
Now!

Alright, here we go

Hail Mary, forgive me
Blood for blood, hearts beating (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Come at me, now this is war (Oh-oh-oh)
Fuck with this new beat, oh

Now terror begins inside a bloodless vein
I was just a product of the street youth rage
Born in this world without a voice or say
Caught in the spokes with an abandoned brain
I know you well, but this ain't a game
Blow the smoke in diamond shape
Dying is a gift, so close your eyes and rest in peace

You told me, ""Think about it,"" well, I did
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of beggin' for the things that I want
I'm over sleepin' like a dog on the floor

I see them laugh in my face
But I've got the power, and I've got the will
I'm not a charity case

I'll take those long nights, impossible odds
Keeping my eye to the keyhole
If it takes all that to be just what I am
Well, I'm gonna be a blue collar man

Make me an offer that I can't refuse
Make me respectable, man
This is my last time in the unemployment line
So like it or not, I'll take those

Long nights, impossible odds
Keeping my back to the wall
If it takes all that to be just what I am
Well, I'm gonna be a blue collar man

Keeping my mind on a better life
Where happiness is only a heartbeat away
Paradise, can it be all I heard it was?
I close my eyes and maybe I'm already there

Ooh, ooh, ooh

I'll take those long nights, impossible odds

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad medicine)

I ain't got a fever; got a permanent disease
And it'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money, but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms, count 'em, one, two, three

First, you need (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little, and it's never enough)
And when you're on your knees (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Now this boy's addicted 'cause your kiss is the drug

Woah-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine

I don't need no needle to be givin' me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction that doesn't leave a track
I gotta jones for your affection like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack

When you need (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little, but it's never enough)
And when you're on your knees (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Now, this boy is addicted for your kiss is the drug

Woah-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
So let's play doctor, baby, cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine
Is what I want
Bad, bad medicine
Oh, it's what I need


I need a respirator 'cause I'm runnin' out of breath
You're an all-night generator wrapped in stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine, you take what you can get
'Cause if there's somethin' better, baby, well, they haven't found it yet

Woah-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
Your love, bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
Your love's the potion that can cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine
Is what I want
Bad, bad medicine
Who's bad? Who's bad?
(Bad, bad medicine) I gotta know, I gotta, I gotta go, I gotta

I gotta, I gotta
I gotta do it again, wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on
I'm not done
One more time, with feelin'
Come on
That's all right
Help me out now

Gazing through the window at the world outside
Wondering will mother earth survive
Hoping that mankind will stop abusing her sometime
After all, there's only just the two of us
And here we are still fighting for our lives
Watching all of history repeat itself time after time

I'm just a dreamer
I dream my life away
I'm just a dreamer
Who dreams of better days

I watch the sun go down like everyone of us
I'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign
A better place for those who will come after us this time

I'm just a dreamer
I dream my life away, oh yeah
I'm just a dreamer
Who dreams of better days

Your higher power may be God or Jesus Christ
It doesn't really matter much to me
Without each other's help there ain't no hope for us
I'm living in a dream of fantasy, oh yeah, yeah, yeah


If only we could all just find serenity
It would be nice if we could live as one
When will all this anger, hate and bigotry be gone?

I'm just a dreamer
I dream my life away, today

I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street
Now, did you read the news today?
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
There, burning into the night

There's too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And there's not much love to go ‘round
Can't you see
This is a land of confusion?

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them, and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

Ooh, Superman, where are you now?
When everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour

This is the time
This is the place
So, we look for the future
But there's not much love to go ‘round
Tell me why this is a land of confusion

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

I remember long ago
Ooh, when the sun was shining
And all the stars were bright
All through the night
In the wake of this madness
As I held you tight
So long ago

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep

Too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go ‘round
Can't you see
This is a land of confusion?

Now, this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them, and let's start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for
This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing
Just where our lives are going to"

(When this began) I had nothin' to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

And I've got nothin' to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Lookin' everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is lookin' at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothin' to gain, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along

You're keeping in step in the line
Got your chin held high and you feel just fine
'Cause you do what you're told
But inside your heart, it is black and it's hollow and it's cold

Just how deep do you believe?
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds?
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you wanna change it?

What if this whole crusade's a charade
And behind it all there's a price to be paid
For the blood which we dine
Justified in the name of the holy and the divine

Just how deep do you believe?
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds?
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you wanna change it?

So naïve
I keep holding on to what I wanna believe
I can see
But I keep holding on and on and on and on
(On and on and on and on)

Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?

When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so

Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who

And everybody's empty and everything is so messed up
Preoccupied, without you, I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

You could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I'll protect you from all of the obscene
I wonder what you're doing, imagine where you are
There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face

Everyone is changing, there's no one left that's real
So make up your own ending and let me know just how you feel
'Cause I am lost without you, I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

And you could be my someone, you could be my scene
Know that I will save you from all of the unclean
I wonder what you're doing, I wonder where you are
There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

No, nobody told me what you thought
Nobody told me what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Told you when to run away
Nobody told you where to hide
Nobody told you what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Showed you when to run away

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
No, this pain you gave to me
This pain you gave to me

Can you take it all, can you take it all away?
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?

Can you take it all away?

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Drop dead
A bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes
Have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction
So tell me what would you say
I'd say it's up to me

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Ignorance
And understanding
We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But who's left to stop the bleeding?
How far
Will we take this?
It's not hard to see through the fakeness
So tell me what would you say
I'd say it's up to me

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe

This can't last forever
Time won't make things better
I feel so alone
Can't help myself
And no one knows
If this
Is worthless
Tell me (tell me, tell me)
So
What have we done
With a war that can't be won?
This can't be real
'Cause I don't know what to feel, no

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason

And when she wakes up and makes up her mind

She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love with an

You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all the presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice

You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe, someday, when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

And when she's walking, she's looking so fine
And when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine

I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there, baby
I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Messages keep getting clearer
Radio's on, and I'm moving 'round my place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
Ah, just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere, and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say, ""You gotta stay hungry""
Hey, baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting around here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now, baby, give me just one look

You can't start a fire
Sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Foot on the pedal, never ever false metal
Engine runnin' hotter than a boiling kettle
My job ain't a job, it's a damn good time
City to city, I'm a-runnin' my rhymes
On location, tourin' around the nation
Beastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger, but a stable turntable
I do what I do best because I'm illin' and able
Ain't no fakin', your money I'm takin'
Goin' coast to coast to watch all the girlies shakin'
While you're at the job workin' nine-to-five
The Beastie Boys at the Garden cold kickin' it live

No sleep 'til

Another plane, another train, another bottle in the brain
Another girl, another fight, another drive all night

Our manager's crazy, he always smokes dust
He's got his own room at the back of the bus
Tour around the world, you rock around the clock
Plane to hotel, girls on the jock
We're trashin' hotels like it's goin' out of style
Gettin' paid along the way 'cause it's worth your while
Four on the floor, Ad-Rock's out the door
MCA's in the back 'cause he's skeezin' with a whore
We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back
White boys got more rhymes

No sleep 'til
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn

Ain't seen the light since we started this band
So, MCA, get on the mic, my man

Born and bred in Brooklyn, USA
They call me Adam Yauch, but I'm MCA
Like a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon
I sip the def ale with all the fly women
Limos, arenas, and TV shows
Autographed pictures and classy hoes
Step off, Holmes, get out of my way
Taxin' little girlies from here to LA
Wakin' up before I get to sleep
'Cause I'll be rockin' this party eight days a week

He who makes a beast out of himself
Gets rid of the pain of being a man

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried, to drive all through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis, here to see
The sand is singing deathless words to me

Can't you help me as I'm starting to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention

As I, adjust to my new sights
The rarely tired lights, will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger, I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
Mental fiction, follow me
Show me what it's like to be set free

Can't you help me as I'm starting to burn? (All alone)

So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long, my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today


Sometimes I don't know why, we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky, for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions, but most just pass us by
Don't want your absolution, 'cause I can't make it right

Gets rid of all the pain of being a man

Can't you help me as I'm starting to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)

So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but

But let me tell you something baby

Now that you’re hooked, it’s all becoming clear
That all your judgments that you placed on me was a reflection of discovery
So maybe next time when you cast your stones

You will crawl up from your hiding place
And take a look in the mirror, see the truth in your face

If my heart could sing, would you stay?
Would you stay and listen, would you stay and listen?

Would you try and fix me, would you help unbreak me?

Your smile, it eats me alive
And I can't turn away any longer

Will you stay here with me, will you ever leave me?

I've been away a little while, sometimes I just can't help myself
When my mind's runnin' wild, I seem to lose grip on reality
And I try to disregard the crazy things the voices tell me to do
But it's no use
I tried to own it, write songs about it
Believe me, I've tried, in the end, I needed to breathe
Find inspiration, some kind of purpose
To take a second to face the shit that makes me me

All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head 'gainst the wall, tryna put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room

I saw the world a couple of times, tried to cure the ache with absence
But that hole was still a hole and my mind kept playin' tricks on me
Feelin' older every day, took everything I had to not crash and burn
But I'm starting to learn
Sometimes I'll fall down, sometimes I'll lose hope
But those days will be few if I keep my feet on the ground
I might be lonely, but I ain't alone here
So I keep pushin' the limits of what makes me me

All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head 'gainst the wall, tryna put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room

(Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely)

I can be better than I was
I can be better than I am
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room

All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head 'gainst the wall, tryna put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room"

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunkt, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

White heat is screamin' in the jungle (Oh, oh-oh)
Complete the motion if you stumble (Oh-oh)
Go ask the dust for any answers (Oh-oh)
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

This chapter's gonna be a close one (Oh, oh-oh)
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one (Oh-oh)
All on a spaceship, persevering (Oh-oh)
Use my hands for everything but steering

Can't stop the spirits when they need you (Oh, oh-oh)
Mop tops are happy when they feed you (Oh-oh)
J. Butterfly is in the treetop (Oh-oh)
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute, I'm passin' out, win or lose
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew
Right on cue

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

Your image in the dictionary

Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades

Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control

And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past 100,000 miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you

Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do"

And you're long gone, gone

It's no surprise to me, I am my own worst enemy
'Cause every now and then, I kick the livin' shit out of me
The smoke alarm is goin' off, and there's a cigarette
Still burnin'

Came in through the window last night

Lyin' in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometimes you picture me, I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're callin' to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, ""Go slow"", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, (I'll be waiting) I will be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watchin' through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting

You say, ""Go slow,"" I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

Fuck, you can't even sing

Early in the mornin', risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet
Got to find the reason, reason things went wrong
Got to find the reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot

Well, life is (Too short), so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static, I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty
Love is what I got, it's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve
Try and test that, you're bound to get served
Love's what I got, don't start a riot
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot

Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
And remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
(I got, I got, I got)

Why I don't cry when my dog runs away
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Fuckin' and fightin'; it's all the same
Living with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

'Cause lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
And remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got
(I got, I got, I got)

We're not that far off
So, that's
See, but
We're done, man"

When there's lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me

I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold, lost my hold
To the shadows of the night

No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark

Do your demons
Do they ever let you go?
When you try, do they hide deep inside?
Is it someone that you know?
You're just a picture
You're an image caught in time
We're a lie, you and I
We're words without a rhyme

There's no sign of the morning coming

You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me

I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear and you'll hear it
Calling you, beware, look out

Baby, I get so scared inside
And I don't really understand
Is it love that's on my mind
Or is it fantasy?
Heaven is in the palm of my hand
And it's waiting here for you
What am I supposed to do
With a childhood tragedy?

If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?

Sometimes, it's hard to hold on
So hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems
When you're face to face with me
Like a dagger, you stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep would you shelter me
In your warm and darkened grave?

If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?

Will you ever take me?
No, I just can't take the pain
Would you ever trust me?
No, I'll never feel the same
Oh


I know I been so hard on you
I know I told you lies
If I could have just one more wish
I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes

If I close my eyes forever

Will it all remain the same?

Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now"

Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
In '65, I was seventeen and running up 101
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on

Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive
In '69, I was twenty-one and I called the road my own
I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on

Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

Everyone I know, everywhere I go
People need some reason to believe
I don't know about anyone but me
If it takes all night, that'll be all right
If I can get you to smile before I leave

Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels
Look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through
Looking into their eyes I see them running too

Running on, running on empty, yeah
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

Honey, you really tempt me
You know the way you look so kind

Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past

From Soho down to Brighton, I must've played 'em all

Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

How do you think he does it? I don't know!
What makes him so good?

Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see no lights a-flashing, plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him

Even on my favourite table, he can beat my best
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball"

Every mornin' there's a halo hangin' from the corner
Of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it
For the weekend or a one-night stand

Couldn't understand
How to work it out
Once again, as predicted, left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out
Something's got me reelin', stopped me from believin'
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it, you know I wanna do it again

(Sugar Ray say) Oh
(Every mornin') Oh (Every mornin' when I wake up)
Shut the door, baby, don't say a word
Oh (She always rights the wrong)
Oh (She always rights, she always rights)
Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby

Every mornin' there's a heartache hangin' from the corner
Of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine and I know she thinks she loves me
But I never can believe what she said

Somethin' so deceiving, when you stop believin'
Turn me around again
Said we couldn't do it, you know I wanna do it again

Oh
(Every mornin') Oh (Every mornin' when I wake up)
Shut the door, baby, don't say a word
Oh

Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby

She always rights the wrong
For me, baby
She always rights the wrong
For me

Every mornin' there's a halo hangin' from the corner
Of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it
For the weekend or a one-night stand

I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep that night 'til the morning came around

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
Spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and he vanished in the air

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, and the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

Fifty thousand watts of power
And it's pushin' overload

All the metal they can hold
Reachin' overload
Start to explode

Call it heavy metal noise

She's riding on razor's edge
She holds her own against the boys
Yeah, cuts through the crowd just like a wedge
Ooh, can you feel the static?
So many contacts being made
We've got up-front fanatics
Tearing down the barricade
To reach the stage
Can you feel the rage?

And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drum

All the tension in the world today
All the little girls fillin' up the world today
When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
But I'ma live my life like I should (Like I should)
Now all the critics wanna hit it
Ya shit can how we did it, just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted, new era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from these critics
But do we always gotta cry?
Do we always gotta live inside a lie?
Life's just a blast that's movin' really fast
You better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass
Follow me into a solo
Remember that, kid? So what you wanna do?
And where you gonna run when you're starin' down the cable of a
Mic pointed at your grill like a gun?
Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set
It's like Russian Roulette, when you're placin', you bet
So don't be upset when you're broke and you're done
'Cause I'ma be the one 'til I jet (I'ma be the one 'til I jet)

I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)

'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

And now you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!
And now you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

Does anybody really know the secret?
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it?
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
But everything happens for a reason (Everything happens for a reason)
I don't even know what I should say
'Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' up my mind every second with my fists
And everybody wanna run (Wanna run)
Everybody wanna hide from the gun (Hide from the gun)
You can take that ride through this life, if you want
But you can't take the edge off the knife (No, sir!)
And now you want your money back (Money back)
But you're denied 'cause your brain's fried from the sack
And there ain't nothin' I can do
'Cause life is a lesson, you learn it when you're through

I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)

When dreaming, I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise, I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't wanna leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is to let love replace all our hate

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

So let's go there (Let's go there)
Let's go there (Let's go there)
Come on, let's go there (Go, go there)
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""


Up high, I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Sail up high, I'm strong enough
To take these dreams and make them mine
Sail up high, I'm strong enough
To take these dreams and make them mine

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?"

Wind me up, put me down, start me off, and watch me go
I'll be runnin' circles around you sooner than you know
A little off-center and I'm out of tune
Just kickin' this can along the avenue, but I'm alright

'Cause it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now, it's already begun
You feel it runnin' through your bones

And you jerk it out, when you jerk it out

Shut up, hush your mouth, can't you hear, you talk too loud?
No, I can't hear, nothing 'cause I got my head up in the clouds
I bite off anything that I can chew
I'm chasing cars up and down the avenue, but that's okay

'Cause it's easy once you know how it's done

You feel it runnin' through your bones

Last day of the rest of my life
I wish I would've known 'cause I didn't kiss my mama goodbye
I didn't tell her that I loved her, how much I cared
Or thank my pops for all the talks and all the wisdom he shared
Unaware, I just did what I always do
Every day, the same routine before I skate off to school
But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest?
Instead of takin' a test, I took two to the chest
Call me blind, but I didn't see it comin'
Everybody was runnin', but I couldn't hear nothin' except
Gun blasts, it happened so fast
I don't really know this kid, though I sit by him in class
Maybe this kid was reachin' out for love
Or maybe for a moment, he forgot who he was
Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
Whatever it was, I know it's because

We are, we are (We are) the youth of the nation
We are, we are (We are) youth of the nation
We are, we are (We are) the youth of the nation
We are, we are (We are) youth of the nation

Little Suzy, she was only twelve
She was given the world with every chance to excel
Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
She might act kind of proud, but no respect for herself
She finds love in all the wrong places
The same situations, just different faces
Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told her she deserved much better
Johnny boy always played the fool
He broke all the rules so you would think he was cool
He was never really one of the guys
No matter how hard he tried, often thought of suicide
It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends
He put his life to an end, they might remember him then
You cross the line and there's no turning back
Told the world how he felt with the sound of a gat

We are, we are (We are) the youth of the nation
We are, we are (We are) youth of the nation
We are, we are (We are) the youth of the nation
We are, we are (We are) youth of the nation

Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim?
No matter what you say, it don't take away the pain
That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies
Don't nobody know why, it's the blind leadin' the blind
Guess that's the way the story goes
Will it ever make sense? Somebody's gotta know
There's gotta be more to life than this
There's gotta be more to everything I thought exists

We are, we are, the youth of the nation
We are, we are, youth of the nation

Lump sat alone in a boggy marsh
Totally motionless except for her heart
Mud flowed up into Lump's pajamas
She totally confused all the passing piranhas

She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump
She might be dead

Lump lingered last in line for brains
And the one she got was sorta rotten and insane
Small things so sad that birds could land
Is Lump fast asleep or rockin' out with the band?

She's Lump, she's Lump

Lump was limp and lonely and needed a shove
Lump slipped on a kiss and tumbled into love
She spent her twenties between the sheets
Life limped along at sub-sonic speeds

She's Lump, she's Lump
She's in my head
She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump
She might be dead
Woo!

I am still living with your ghost
Lonely and dreaming of the west coast
I don't want to be your downtime
I don't want to be your stupid game

With my big black boots and an old suitcase
I do believe I'll find myself a new place
I don't want to be the bad guy
I don't want do your sleepwalk dance anymore

I just want to see some palm trees
I will try and shake away this disease

We could live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die
We could live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die

I am still dreaming of your face
Hungry and hollow for all the things you took away
I don't want to be your good time
I don't want to be your fall-back crutch anymore

I'll walk right out into a brand new day
Insane and rising in my own weird way
I don't want to be the bad guy
I don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore

I just want to feel some sunshine
I just want to find some place to be alone

Is it worth it, can you even hear me?
Standing with your spotlight on me
Not enough to feed the hungry
I'm tired, and I felt it for a while now
In this sea of lonely
The taste of ink is getting old
It's four o' clock in the fucking morning
Each day gets more and more like the last day
Still, I can see it coming
While I'm standing in the river drowning
This could be my chance to break out
This could be my chance to say goodbye
At last, it's finally over
Couldn't take this town much longer
Being half-dead wasn't what I planned to be
Now I'm ready to be free

So here I am, it's in my hands
And I'll savor every moment of this
So here I am, alive at last
And I'll savor every moment of this

Don't you think I'm pretty
When I'm standing top the bright-lit city?
And I'll take your hand and pick you up
And keep you there so you can see it
So long as you're alive and care
I promise I will take you there
We'll drink and dance the night away
We can drink and dance the night away

The stars that pierce the sky, he left them all behind
We’re left to wonder why he left us all behind

Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh

Dreams of his crash won’t pass, oh, how they all adored him
Beauty will last when spiraled down
The stars that mystify, he left them all behind
And how his children cried, ""He left us all behind!""

Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh...

What's the hook, the twist within this verbose mystery?
I would gladly bet my life upon it
That the ghost you love, your ray of light will fizzle out
Without hope
We're the empty set just floating through empty skin
Ever searching for what we were promised
Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go
But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh
Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Oh-oh!"

Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, that could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul, it was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands
And we sang

Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And we danced on into the night
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)

And we danced on into the night
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)

Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place
You could tell how we felt from the look on our faces
We were spinning in circles with the moon in our eyes
No room left to move in-between you I
We forgot where we were and we lost track of time
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night
And we sang

Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And we danced on into the night

You know that I'd die too

Should I bite my tongue
Until blood soaks my shirt
We'll never fall apart
Tell me why this hurts so much
My hands are at your throat
And I think I hate you
But still we'll say ""remember when?""

He said, ""Son, have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say, if I said that you could?
Just carry this gun, you'll even get paid""
I said, ""That sounds pretty good""
Black leather boots, spit-shined so bright
They cut off my hair, but it looks alright
We marched and we sang, we all became friends
As we learned how to fight

A hero of war
Yeah, that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
'Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

I kicked in the door, I yelled my commands
The children, they cried, but I got my man
We took him away, a bag over his face
From his family and his friends
They took off his clothes, they pissed in his hands
I told them to stop, but then I joined in
We beat him with guns, and batons not just once
But again and again

A hero of war
Yeah, that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
'Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

She walked through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop, I begged her to stay
But she pressed on, so I lifted my gun
And I fired away
And the shells jumped through the smoke
And into the sand that the blood now had soaked
She collapsed with a flag in her hand
A flag white as snow

A hero of war
Is that what they see?
Just medals and scars
So damn proud of me
And I brought home that flag
Now it gathers dust
But it's a flag that I love
It's the only flag I trust

He said, ""Son
Have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say
If I said that you could?"""

It was 1989, my thoughts were short, my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Catching walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

While we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
""Sweet Home Alabama,"" oh, yeah
Turn it up!

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man, I'd love to see that girl again
(Man, I'd love to see that girl again) Yeah

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

Somewhere there's speaking, it's already coming in
Oh, and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen, listen and wait for
The echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want, he's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things at exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you, and you don't know why

You're waiting for someone to put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

He's everything you want, he's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things at exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you, and you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight and watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine with all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island and into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice, but you still hide away the
Anger of angels who won't return

He's everything you want, he's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things at exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you, and you don't know why

I am everything you want, I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you that you wish you could be
I say all the right things at exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you, and I don't know why

And I don't know why

When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb
Okay (Okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying

Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone

The way the streetlight silhouettes your thighs inside your dress
Wild child in the streets, I think I seen you, but I really don't know
Who knows?

Ooh, I wish you'd take a look and see the shape I'm in

Where the down boys go (Go!)

You're giving me the runaround, make me feel like a fool

I don't care where we go tonight, take me along with you

Woke up to the sound of pourin' rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name

And when you needed me, I came through

I paint a picture of the days gone by
When love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes

So that I knew that you were there for me
Time after time, you were there for me

Remember yesterday, walkin' hand in hand
Love letters in the sands, I remember you
And through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say, ""I remember you""
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

We spent the summer with the top rolled down
Wished ever after would be like this
You said ""I love you, babe,"" without a sound


I said I'd give up my life for just one kiss
I'd live for your smile and die for your kiss

Remember yesterday, walkin' hand in hand
Love letters in the sands, I remember you
And through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say, ""I remember you,"" oh

We've had our share of hard times
But that's the price we paid
And through it all, we kept the promise that we made
Well, I swear you'll never be lonely


Oh, oh-oh-oh

We woke up to the sound of pourin' rain
Washed away a dream of you
But nothin' else could ever take you away

'Cause you'll always be my dream come true
Woah, my darlin', I love you

Remember yesterday, walkin' hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you

I fear rivers overflowing, I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Alright


Hope you got your things together, hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather, one eye is taken for an eye

Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, “My God, they killed them all!”

Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Three bodies lyin' there, does Patty see
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously
“I didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands
“I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand

I saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops
“One of us had better call up the cops”
And so Patty calls the cops, and they arrive on the scene
With their red lights flashin' in the hot New Jersey night

Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that’s just the way things go
If you’re black, you might as well not show up on the street
Unless you want to draw the heat

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around
He said, “I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”

And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him he could identify the guilty men

Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
They take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
Say, “Why did you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!”

Here’s the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin’s in South America, fighting for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game
And the cops are putting the screws to him
Lookin' for somebody to blame

“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”
“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”
“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”
“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw
Running that night?”
“Don’t forget that you are white”

Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”
The cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job, and we’re talking to your friend Bello
Now you don’t want to have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow

You’ll be doing society a favor
That son of a bitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder
On him
He ain’t no Gentleman Jim”

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
""It’s my work"", he’d say, ""and I do it for pay""
""And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way""

Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse

All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum

And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed

Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder “one”, guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride

How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed
To live in a land where justice is a game

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink Martinis, and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell

Yes that’s the story of the Hurricane
But it won’t be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he’s done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world"

And a blade shining oh so bright
There's evil in the air and there's thunder in sky
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets
Oh, and down in the tunnel where the deadly are rising
Oh, I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter
He was starting to foam in the heat

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light
But I gotta get out, I gotta break it out now
Before the final crack of dawn
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know we'll both be so alone

Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes
Oh, when the night is over
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone gone gone
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes
But when the day is done and the sun goes down
And the moonlight's shining through
Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven
I'll come crawling on back to you

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
On a silver black phantom bike
When the metal is hot and the engine is hungry
And we're all about to see the light
Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole
Everything is stunted and lost
And nothing really rocks and nothing really rolls
And nothing's ever worth the cost
And I know that I'm damned if I never get out
And maybe I'm damned if I do
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart
You know I'd rather be damned with you
If I gotta be damned, you know I wanna be damned
Dancing through the night with you
Well If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned (gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned)
Gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned (gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned)
Gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned (gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned)

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light
But I gotta get out, I gotta break it out now
Before the final crack of dawn
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know we'll both be so alone

Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes
When the night is over
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone, gone, gone
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes
But when the day is done and the sun goes down
And the moonlight's shining through (Oo-oo-ooh)
Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven
I'll come crawling on back to you
Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven
I'll come crawling on back to you


Oh, I can see myself tearing up the road
Faster than any other boy has ever gone
And my skin is raw, but my soul is ripe
And no one's gonna stop me now
I'm gonna make my escape
But I can't stop thinking of you
And I never see the sudden curve 'til it's way too late
And I never see the sudden curve 'til it's way too late

Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun (ooh)
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike (ooh)
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell (aah)
And the last thing I see is my heart still beating
I'm breaking out of my body and flying away
Like a bat out of hell
Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun
Oh, torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell (ooh)
And the last thing I see is my heart still beating, still beating

With her high-laced stockings and her sweater so tight
I asked her her name, she said her name was ""Maybe.""

Well she walked up to me, and she asked me to chance
I said, ""I am lookin' for some wild romance,""
She gave me a wink--she said I should think about it, maybe

She said, ""What you got babe, is what I need
Your kind of love got me on my knees.""
I'm so tied up
What you got got a hold on me, your kind of love make a man outta me
I'm so tied up, you got me so fired up

She can't help it, she's comin' of age
Little junior, he's all in a rage
Did you notice she was comin' of age

If looks could kill, I'd be dead on the floor
You got me all tied up, honey, beggin' for more

I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed
Will set two lovers' souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes
Testing our communication

The light that fueled our fire then
Has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end
Crippling our communication

I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame
It doesn't mean I don't desire
To point the finger, blame the other
Watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together
Rediscover communication

The poetry that comes from
The squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance

There was a time that the pieces fit
But I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second-guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication

Cold silence has a tendency to
Atrophy any sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers
Between supposed lovers

I know the pieces fit

I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit

But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me
In some old-fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing, every little thing
Every, every little thing
Every little, every little, every little
Every little thing she does

Ah!

Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
The way that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life
Forced in; like cattle, you run
Stripped out your life's worth
Human mice for the angel of death
Four hundred thousand more to die

Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead

Sadistic, surgeon of demise
Sadist of the noblest blood
Destroying without mercy
To benefit the Aryan race
Surgery with no anesthesia
Feel the knife pierce you intensely
Inferior, no use to mankind
Strapped down, screaming out to die

Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher
Angel of death


Pumped with fluid inside your brain
Pressure in your skull begins pushin' through your eyes
Burning flesh drips away
Test of heat burns your skin
Your mind starts to boil
Frigid cold cracks your limbs
How long can you last in this frozen-water burial?
Sewn together, joining heads
Just a matter of time 'til you rip yourselves apart

Millions laid out in their
Crowded tombs
Sickening ways to achieve
The Holocaust

Seas of blood bury life
Smell your death as it burns deep inside of you
Abacinate, eyes that bleed
Praying for the end of your wide-awake nightmare
Wings of pain reach out for you
His face of death staring down, your blood's running cold
Injecting cells, dying eyes
Feeding on the screams of the mutants he's creating

Pathetic, harmless victims left to die
Rancid angel of death
Flying free


Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher
Angel of death
Angel of death"

Do you have the time to listen to me whine
About nothin' and everything all at once?
I am one of those melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringin' me down
I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
So quit my whinin' 'cause it's bringin' her down

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor?

What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words, but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)

To be a joke and, look, another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

I'm not okay, I'm not okay, hey, hey, hey

Forget about the dirty looks

You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed now

And then produced my rapier

Or the devil he may take ya"".

I took all of his money
And it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money
And I brought it home to Molly

Never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman
For you know she tricked me easy

Being drunk and weary
I went to Molly's chamber
Takin' my money with me
And I never knew the danger

For about six or maybe seven
In walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols
And I shot him with both barrels

You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park, but meantime
South of the river, you stop
And you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie, double-four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain
To hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they're blowing that sound

Way on down south
Way on down south, London town
You check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind
If he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job
He's doing alright
He can play the honky-tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night

With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing
Yeah

And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll

And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole


And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
“Goodnight, now it's time to go home”
Then he makes it fast with one more thing

“We are the Sultans
We are the Sultans of Swing”"

Working for the FBI
Sitting in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high
Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman singing a song
A pair of 45's made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9"" beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all
Woo!
I saw her head up to the table
With a tall walking big black cat
Well, Charlie said ""I hope that you're able, boy
'Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at""
When suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
I jumped down and across the table
When I heard somebody shooting a gun

Well, the DA was pumping my left hand
And then she was a-holding my right
Well, I told her ""Don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared""
Well I've gotta be forgiven
If I wanna spend my living
With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9"" beautiful tall
Well, with just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all
Had it all, had it all

Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light

We get to carry each other, carry each other

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should

In the hard crowd
Consolation, for the old wound
Now forgotten
Yellow tigers, crouched in jungles
In her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies
But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it

No one knows what it's like
To be mistreated
To be defeated
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows how to say
That they're sorry
And don't worry
I'm not tellin' lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man

Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself

But maybe sometime if you feel the pain
You'll find you're all alone, everything has changed

Play the game
You know you can't quit until it's won
Soldier on
Only you can do what must be done
You know in some way you're a lot like me
You're just a prisoner
And you're trying to break free

Underneath the blazin' sky

Gonna be a man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's Fire

Burnin' up
Don't know just how far that I can go (Just how far I go)
Soon be home
Only just a few miles down the road
I can make it, I know I can
You broke the boy in me
But you won't break the man

I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin' higher and higher
Gonna be a man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's Fire

I can climb the highest mountain
Cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burnin' in me
Burnin' in me

Just once in his life, a man has his time
And my time is now, I'm coming alive

I can hear the music playin'
I can see the banners fly

Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's fire

If you feel like letting go (hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well hang on

'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts

Don't throw your hand, oh no
Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you're not alone

If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much
Of this life to hang on

Well, everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody cries
Everybody hurts, sometimes
And everybody hurts sometimes

So hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Everybody hurts
No, no, no, no, no, you're not alone"

I'm all out of hope
One more bad break could bring a fall
When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone to tell me you're alone
It's easy to deceive
It's easy to tease, but hard to get release

(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
Got no human grace, your eyes without a face

Ooh, ch-ch

I spent so much time
Believing all the lies to keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth for loving what was you

(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
Got no human grace, your eyes without a face

Ooh, ha


When you hear the music, you make a dip
Into someone else's pocket, then make a slip
Steal a car and go to Las Vegas
Ooh, the gigolo pool
Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Drinking it down
Oh-oh-oh
I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books, trying to stay hip
I'm thinking of you and you're out there, so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why I don't despise
Now all I can do
Is love what was once so alive and new
But it's gone from your eyes
I'd better realise

(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
Got no human grace, your eyes without a face

Such a human waste, your eyes without a face

And now it's getting worse"

And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis

You know, it's kinda hard just to get along today
Our subject isn't cool, but he fakes it anyway
He may not have a clue and he may not have style
But everything he lacks, well, he makes up in denial

So don't debate a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field and keep it real
For you, no way, for you, no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabes, ah
Hey, hey, do that brand new thing!

Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy

He needs some cool tunes, not just any will suffice
But they didn't have Ice Cube, so he bought Vanilla Ice
Now cruisin' in his Pinto, he sees homies as he pass
But if he looks twice, they're gonna kick his lily ass

So don't debate a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field and keep it real
For you, no way, for you, no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world loves wannabes, ah
Hey, hey, do that brand new thing!

Now he's gettin' a tattoo, yeah, he's gettin' ink done
He asked for a thirteen, but they drew a thirty-one
Friends say he's tryin' too hard and he's not quite hip
But in his own mind, he's the, he's the dopest trip

Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis

So don't debate a player straight

Much easier to turn away
Than to take a look inside
So you're thinking it's over
Walking away
Let your little world crash and burn
Oh, what a price to pay

Didn't anybody tell you?
It's not who's right or wrong
Hold the line
Is this what's going on?

Where you going now?
When your world's turned inside out
Isn't love what it's all about?
Where you going now?
When you get to the top of the hill
Gonna be there, yes I will

There's a crack in the mirror
There's a hole in the sun
Full moon in the midnight sky
And you feel like you wanna run

So you blow out the candle
And you turn off the light
Then you stumble into darkness
Do you believe that love is blind?

Didn't anybody tell you?
It's never too late to try
Hold the line
Before you say goodbye

Where you going now?
When your world's turned inside out
Isn't love what it's all about?
Where you going now?
When you get to the top of the hill
Gonna be there, yes I will

Now I'm not talking 'bout what's good for me
And I'm not saying, how you ought to be
But if there is a message shining on through to you
Take a little piece of mind
And let your love light shine


Didn't anybody tell you?
It's never too late to try
Hold the line
Before you say goodbye

Where you going now?
When your world's turned inside out
Isn't love what it's all about?
Where you going now?
When you get to the top of the hill
Gonna be there, yes I will
Where you going now?
When your world's turned inside out
Isn't love what it's all about?
Where you going now?
When you get to the top of the hill
Gonna be there, yes I will
Gonna be there, yes I will"

Breathe in for luck, breathe in so deep
This air is blessed, you share with me
This night is wild, so calm and dull
These hearts, they race, from self control
Your legs are smooth as they graze mine
We're doing fine, we're doing nothing at all

My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me
So won't you kill me, so I die happy?
My heart is yours to fill or burst to break or bury
Or wear as jewelry, whichever you prefer

The words are hushed, let's not get busted
Just lay entwined here, undiscovered
Safe in here from all the stupid questions
""Hey, did you get some?"" Man, that is so dumb
Stay quiet, stay near, stay close, they can't hear
So we can get some

My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me
So won't you kill me, so I die happy?
My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury
Or wear as jewelry, whichever you prefer

Hands down, this is the best day I can
Ever remember, I'll always remember the sound
Of the stereo, the dim of the soft lights
The scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers
And the time on the clock when we realized it's so late
And this walk that we shared together
The streets were wet, and the gate was locked
So I jumped it and I let you in
And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist
And you kissed me like you meant it
And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it, that you meant it
And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it"

At 23 on the verge of spontaneous combustion, woe is me

So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same

In a book and I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knee
I said, ""I can relate,"" 'cause lately, I've been
Thinking of combustication as a welcomed vacation from
The burdens of the planet Earth
Like gravity, hypocrisy and the perils of being in 3D
But thinking so much differently, yeah

Met a girl, thought she was grand
Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued

In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fucking hates me
Trust
She fucking hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

She was queen for about an hour
After that, shit got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt
No feeling of bad, no

In a box high up on the shelf

Wrapped in guilt, sealed up tight""

To win the honor of coming back home again

Unlock the dark destroyer that's buried within

You will discover a war you're unable to win

I'll have you know that I've become

Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold

That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war

Another reason, another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered now for me to light
My dedication to all that I've sworn to protect
I carry out my orders without a regret
My declaration embedded deep under the skin
A permanent reminder of how it began
No hesitation when I am commanded to strike
You need to know that you're in for the fight of your life

Fell in love with a girl
I fell in love once and almost completely
She's in love with the world
But sometimes, these feelings can be so misleading
She turns and says, ""Are you alright?""
I said, ""I must be fine 'cause my heart's still beating""
""Come and kiss me by the riverside, yeah
Bobby says it's fine, he don't consider it cheating, now""

Red hair with a curl
Mello-Roll for the flavor, and the eyes were peeping
Can't keep away from the girl
These two sides of my brain need to have a meeting

Can't think of anything to do, yeah
My left brain knows that all love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new, yeah
I said it once before, but it bears repeating now

Ah, ah

When I passed you in the doorway
Well, you took me with a glance
I should have took that last bus home
But I asked you for a dance
Now we go steady to the pictures
I always get chocolate stains on my pants
And my father, he's going crazy
He says I'm living in a trance

But I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight (It's alright, alright)
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long, hot summer night

It's three o'clock in the morning
And I'm on the streets again
I disobeyed another warning
I should've been in by ten
Now I won't get out 'til Sunday
I'll have to say I stayed with friends
Oh, but it's a habit worth forming
If it means to justify the ends

Dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight (It's alright, alright)
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long, hot summer night

And I'm walking home
The last bus is long gone
But I'm dancing in the moonlight

I get the same old dreams, same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up
So I get out of bed put on my shoes and in my head
Thoughts fly back to the break-up

These four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you've put me in

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
You cast the spell so break it
Oh-oh-oh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Since you been gone

So in the night, I stand, beneath the back street light
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon, the night-time comes around too soon
You can't know what you mean to me

Your poison letter, your telegram
Just goes to show you don't give a damn

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
You cast the spell so break it
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh
Since you been gone


If you will come back, baby you know
You'll never do wrong

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
You cast the spell so break it

Packed in a suitcase by her feet

Bright as they did

And the work seemed harder
And the days seemed longer
Than she ever thought they'd be
But you know you got to stick to your guns
When it all comes down
Cause sometimes you can't choose

Tail you're gonna lose

Lose big, livin' out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rollin' the dice of her life

Livin' day to day
Turned her back on her best friends, yeah
And watched her family slip away
Just like a lost soul
Caught up in the Hollywood scene
All the parties and limousines

Such a good actress
Hiding all her pain
Trading in memories for fortune and fame
Just a step away from the edge of the fall
Caught between Heaven and Hell

Too much too soon
Or just a little too late

She wasn't there and it just wouldn't wait"

In a darkened room
Beyond the reach of God's faith
Lies the wounded
The shattered remains of love betrayed
And the innocence
Of a child is bought and sold
In the name of the damned
The rage of the angels left silent and cold

Forgive me, please, for I know not what I do
How can I keep inside the hurt I know is true?

Well, tell me when the kiss of love becomes a lie
That bears the scar of sin too deep to hide behind
This fear of runnin' unto you
Please let there be light in a darkened room

All the precious times
Have been put to rest again
And the smile of the dawn
Brings tainted lust singin' my requiem
Can I face the day
When I'm tortured in my trust
And watch it crystallize
While my salvation, it crumbles to dust?

Why can't I steer the ship before it hits the storm?
I've fallen into the sea, but still I swim for shore

Tell me when the kiss of love becomes a lie
That bears the scar of sin too deep to hide behind
This fear of runnin' unto you
Please let there be light

Do you remember
The twenty-first night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away, oh yeah

Hey, hey, hey

My thoughts are with you
Holdin' hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love, remember
How we knew love was here to stay
Now December
Found a love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love, remember
True love we share today

Hey, hey, hey (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Put on my blue suede shoes
And I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy
Won't you look down over me?
Yeah I've got a first class ticket
But I'm as blue as a boy can be

Then I'm walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

Saw the ghost of Elvis
On Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered around his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for The King
Down in the Jungle Room

When I was walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis

Now Muriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said
""Tell me are you a Christian child?""
And I said
""Ma'am I am tonight""

Walking in Memphis
(Walking in Memphis)
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
(Walking in Memphis)
But do I really feel the way I feel?
Walking in Memphis

But do I really feel the way I feel?

Put on my blue suede shoes
And I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain

Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring

I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault

I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone


I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
And I can't wait 'til I get home
To pass the time in my room alone"

Fuck

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right

But then if you're so smart
Tell me why are you still so afraid? Mm
Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You'd better cool it off before you burn it out
You've got so much to do
And only so many hours in a day, hey

That you can get what you want or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh

Slow down, you're doin' fine
You can't be everything you wanna be before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight
Too bad, but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself, that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong
You know you can't always see when you're right
You're right

You've got your passion, you've got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true, ooh
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?


Slow down, you crazy child
And take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while

The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sittin' next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin
He says, ""Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad, and it's sweet, and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""

Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me""
As the smile ran away from his face
""Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the navy
And probably will be for life
And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone


Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

Sounded sad upon the radio
Moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along, who'd blame them?
You're grown (You're grown up)
So grown (So grown up)
Now I must say more than ever (Come on, Eileen)
Toora, loora, toora, loo-rye-aye
And we can sing just like our fathers

Come on, Eileen

At this moment
You mean everything
You in that dress
My thoughts, I confess
Verge on dirty
Oh, come on, Eileen

Come on, Eileen

These people 'round here
Were beaten down, eyes sunk in smoke-dried face
They're resigned to what their fate is
But no, not us (No, never)
No, not us (No, never)
We are far too young and clever (Remember)
Toora, loora, toora, loo-rye-aye
Eileen, I'll hum this tune forever

Come on, Eileen
Oh, I swear (Well, he means)
Ah, come on, let's
Take off everything
That pretty red dress

Ah, come on, let's
Ah, come on, Eileen

Woah (Well, he means)
Oh-ho-ho-ho

That I gaze on so fondly today
Were to suddenly leave you or fly in the night

On a cold winter morning
In the time before the light
In flames of Death's eternal reign
We ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down
And the times are tough, alright
The sound of evil laughter falls
Around the world tonight
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel
Through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell
Bodies wasted on the shores

On the blackest plains, in hell's domain
We watch them as they go
In fire and pain, now once again
We know

So now, we fly ever free, we're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness, our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls
So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on


As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They'll raise their hands to the heavens above
With resentment in their eyes
Running back through the mid-morning light
There's a burning in my heart
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
To a life beyond the stars

In your darkest dreams, see to believe
Our destiny this time
And endlessly we'll all be free
Tonight

And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality
All alone in desperation, now the time has gone
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind
Day after day, this misery must go on
So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on


Woah, woah
Woah
Woah, woah
Woah


Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
We fought so hard, now can we understand?
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every man

So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on"

You see 'em comin' at you every night
Strung on pretension, they fall for you at first sight, mmm
You know their business, you think it's a bore
They make you restless, it's nothin' you ain't seen before

Get around town, spend your time on the run
You never let down, say you do it for fun
You never miss a play, though you make quite a few
You give it all away, everybody wants you
Yeah

You crave attention, you can never say no
Throw your affections any way the wind blows
You always make it, you're on top of the scene
You sell the copy like the cover of a magazine, ooh

Puttin' on the eyes till there's nobody else
You never realize what you do to yourself
The things that they see make the daily reviews
You never get free when everybody wants you

Everybody knows you
Everybody snows you
Everybody leads you, needs you, bleeds you
Ooh

Nights of confusion and impossible dreams
Days at the mirror, patchin' up around the seams
You got your glory, you paid for it all
You take your pension in loneliness and alcohol

Say goodbye to conventional ways
You can't escape the hours, you lose track of the days
The more you understand, seems the more like you do
You never get away when everybody wants you, ooh

Everybody wants you
Everybody wants you"

One, two
One, two, three, uh!

Yeah
I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely
Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her

Built like she was, she had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here, I put her on the back of my bike and, uh, we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm
I said, now, overcast days never turned me on
But something 'bout the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright, but I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star
Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again, ooh
I wouldn't change a stroke 'cause, baby, I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

(Raspberry beret) Oh!
The kind you find (The kind you find)
The kind you find (In a second-hand store)
Oh, no, no

(And if it was warm)
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (She wouldn't wear much more)
Yeah (Raspberry beret)
Aah!

Yeah! Whoa!
Well, I remember the sparks that flew
In the summer of '79
My brother went wild for a pretty girl's smile
But he didn't care that she was mine
We fought each other like never before
And beat 'til we were black and blue
And when we told her it was time, she'd made up her mind
She said, ""I've had it with the both of you!""

That was when the pact was made
That no woman could sever
We swore it brother for the rest of our lives
We would stick together forever 'cause . 
Two heads are better than one (woo hoo hoo)
It's double the pleasure, baby, triple the fun
I said two (two) heads (heads) are better than one (better than one)
It'll make you come undone
Two heads are better than one
Well, we found ourselves in Vegas, the city of sin
We were restless and looking to play
When this little blonde dolly in the hotel lobby
Blew a kiss as she walked our way
She said, ""I'm feelin' kind of lonely,"" and gave us a wink
Feeling bold we expressed our intentions
We said, ""you gotta have both,""
She said, ""That's a joke!
It takes two just to get my attention!""

Both to share and share alike
That's a part of our lifestyle
So I'm gonna tell you, baby, just where we stand
If you won't love us both
It ain't worthwhile because . 
Two heads are better than one (woo hoo hoo)
It's double the pleasure, triple the fun
I said two heads are better than one
It'll make you come undone
Two heads are better than one
We've come this far together
It's too late for turning back
But it's only fair to warn you
That when you rock with the boys
You never go back! Oh no!
Two heads are better than one
It's double the pleasure, triple the fun
I tell ya two heads are better than one
It'll make you come undone
Nothing's better than .

A policeman knew my name
He said, “You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away”
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwing punches around
And preaching from my chair

Tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

I took the tube back out of town
Back to the Rolling Pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin
I stretched back, and I hiccuped and looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan

Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?

I guess this time you're really leavin'
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well, as my broken heart lies bleedin'
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimmin' for the shore
You left me drownin' in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I pray to God you'll give me one more chance, girl

I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hidin' place
Well, I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday
And, baby, you know my hands are dirty
And baby, you know my hands are dirty
But I wanted to be your Valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine, woah

I'll be there for you, these five words I'd swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you


I wasn't there when you were happy
I wasn't there to make you happy
And I wasn't there when you were down, child
Didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out
Oh-oh

If I can't have you right now, I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense but I can't speed up the time

Said, woman, take it slow and things will be just fine

Stoppin' on the byways
Playin' rock 'n' roll

Gettin' robbed, gettin' stoned
Gettin' beat up, broken-boned
Gettin' had, gettin' took
I tell you, folks, it's harder than it looks

It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
If you think it's easy doin' one-night stands
Try playin' in a rock-roll band
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll



Hotel, motel
Make you wanna cry
Ladies do the hard sell
Know the reason why

Gettin' old, gettin' grey
Gettin' ripped off, underpaid
Gettin' sold, second-hand
That's how it goes, playin' in a band

It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
If you wanna be a star of stage and screen
Look out, it's rough and mean
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll

Well, it's a long way

The steps that I retrace, the sad look on your face
The timing and structure, did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short, I'm writing the report
On losing and failing, when I move, I'm flailing now
And it's happened once again, I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands, and sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone, and I've been here for too long
To face this on my own, well, I guess this is growing up

Well, I guess this is growing up

And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last, when he's gone, I won't come back

And it'll happen once again, you'll turn to a friend

A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade

Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle, monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the Fistagons, the bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord

World turns black and white
Pictures in an empty room
Your love starts falling down
Better change your tune
Yeah, you reach for the golden ring
You reach for the sky
Baby, just spread your wings

And get higher and higher
Straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher
Leave it all behind

Run, run, run away
Like a train runnin' off the track
Got the truth bein' left behind
Fall between the cracks
Standin' on broken dreams
Never losin' sight, ah
Well, just spread your wings

We'll get higher and higher
Straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher
Leave it all behind

So baby, dry your eyes
Save all the tears you've cried
Oh, that's what dreams are made of
'Cause we belong
In a world that must be strong
Oh, that's what dreams are made of


Yeah, we'll get higher and higher
Straight up we'll climb
Higher and higher
Leave it all behind
Oh, we'll get higher and higher
Who knows what we'll find

On dreams we will depend

Buffalo soldier, dreadlock Rasta
There was a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
I mean it, when I analyze the stench
To me, it makes a lot of sense
How the dreadlock Rasta
Was a Buffalo Soldier

And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said it was a Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America

If you know your history
Then you would know where you're coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the heck do I think I am?

I'm just a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier, in the war for America

Said he, woy, yoy, yoy, woy, yoy-yoy, yoy

Driven from the mainland to the heart of the Caribbean

Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong, I was wrong
If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just want to be with you

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you

I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you-know-who
He said, ""Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow
What you trying to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you""
I said, ""Excuse me""

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, and mean, and
Big and bad, Lord, a-pointing that gun at me
""Oh wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble with you
And I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you""

""Oh won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see-a me no more
For sure""


Well the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you, son, well, it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well he turned and there screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door

""Oh won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see-a me no more

To get my fair share of abuse

To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And, man, did he look pretty ill
We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was ""dead""
I said to him:

You can't always get what you want, well, no

In her glass was a bleeding man

I met you on somebody's island
You thought you had known me before
I brought you a crate of papaya
They waited all night by your door
You probably wouldn't remember
I probably couldn't forget
Jungle love in the surf in the pouring rain
Everything's better when wet

Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy

But lately, you live in the jungle
I never see you alone
But we need some definite answers
So I thought I would write you a poem
The question to everyone's answer
Is usually asked from within
But the patterns of the rain
And the truth they contain
Have written my life on your skin

Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy, crazy
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy

You treat me like I was your ocean
You swim in my blood when it's warm
My cycles of circular motion
Protect you and keep you from harm
You live in a world of illusion
Where everything's peaches and cream
We all face a scarlet conclusion
But we spend our time in a dream

Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy, crazy
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy, crazy

Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy, crazy
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy"

It's all moving way too fast
Use every alibi and words you deny
That love ain't meant to last
You can cry tough baby, it's all right
You can let me down easy, but not tonight

Fuck, you can't even sing

Early in the mornin', risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet
Got to find the reason, reason things went wrong
Got to find the reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot

Well, life is (Too short), so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static, I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty
Love is what I got, it's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve
Try and test that, you're bound to get served
Love's what I got, don't start a riot
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot

Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
And remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
(I got, I got, I got)

Why I don't cry when my dog runs away
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Fuckin' and fightin'; it's all the same
Living with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

'Cause lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
And remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got

We're not that far off
So, that's
See, but
We're done, man"

Come out, Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Aww, but sooner or later, it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
Aww, but they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done

Well, only the good die young
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You mighta heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
Aww, but that never hurt no one
So come on, Virginia, show me a sign
Send up a signal, I'll throw you the line
The stained glass curtain you're hidin' behind
Never lets in the sun
Darlin', only the good die young
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I tell ya, only the good die young
Only the good die young

You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
Mmm, and a cross of gold
But Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary
Oh woah woah

And they say there's a heaven for those who will wait
And some say it's better, but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun

You know that only the good die young
Oh-oh-ho, baby
I tell ya, only the good die young
Only the good die young


You said your mother told you, ""All that I could give you was a reputation""
Aww, she never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me?
Oh woah woah

Well, come out, come out, come out, Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
But sooner or later, it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one

You know that only the good die young
Tell you, baby
You know that only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good

On the back of a hurricane that started turning

And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live

You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while

I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me, yeah

Everything I know, and anywhere I go (Yeah)
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And when the last one falls (Woah)
When it's all said and done
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love
Woah, oh, woah, oh, woah, woah, woah

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, woah"

Whoa ooh

I look at you, and my blood boils hot
I feel my temperature rise
I want it all, give me what you got
There's hunger in your eyes
I'm getting closer, baby, hear me breathe (Hah, hah, hah)
You know the way to gimme what I need
Just let me love you, and you'll never leave

Feel my heat taking you higher
Burn with me, Heaven's on fire
Paint the sky with desire
Angel fly, Heaven's on fire (Whoo)

I got a fever raging in my heart
You make me shiver and shake
Baby, don't stop, take it to the top
Eat it like a piece of cake
You're coming closer, I can hear you breathe (Hah, hah, hah)
You drive me crazy when you start to tease
You could bring the devil to his knees

Feel my heat taking you higher
Burn with me, Heaven's on fire
Paint the sky with desire
Angel fly, Heaven's on fire

Oh, Heaven's on fire
Oh, Heaven's on fire
Oh


I'm getting closer, baby, hear me breathe (Hah, hah, hah)
You know the way to give me what I need
Just let me love you, and you'll never leave

Feel my heat taking you higher
Burn with me, Heaven's on fire
Paint the sky with desire
Angel fly, Heaven's on fire
Feel my heat taking you higher
Burn with me, Heaven's on fire
Paint the sky with desire
Angel fly, Heaven's on fire

Feel my heat taking you higher
Burn with me, Heaven's on fire
Paint the sky with desire
Angel fly, Heaven's on fire"

Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Oh, down beside that red firelight?
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go around

Hey, I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before
I left my nursery, huh
Left alone with big fat Fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Hey, big woman
You made a bad boy out of me
Hey, hey, woo!

I've been singing with my band
Cross the water, cross the land
I've seen every blue-eyed
Floozy on the way, hey
But their beauty and their style
Went kinda smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time
Come on

Oh, won't you take me home tonight
Oh, down beside your red firelight?
Oh, and you give it all you got
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go around
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go around

Hey, listen here
Now, I got mortgages on homes
I got stiffness in my bones
Ain't no beauty queens
In this locality, I tell you
Oh, but I still get my pleasure
Still got my greatest treasure
Big, big woman, you gonna make
A big man of me, now get this

(Oh, I know) Are you gonna
Take me home tonight? (Please)
Oh, down beside that red firelight?
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go around
(Yeah) Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go around
Get on your bikes and ride!

Ooh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Them fat bottomed girls
(Fat bottomed girls)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright, ride 'em cowboy
(Fat bottomed girls)
Yes, yes!"

Ooh, my little pretty one, pretty one
When you gonna give me some time, Sharona?
Ooh, you make my motor run, my motor run
Gun it coming off of the line, Sharona

Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind
I always get it up for the touch of the younger kind
My, my, my, I, yi, woo!
M-m-m-my Sharona

Come a little closer, huh, ah, will ya, huh?
Close enough to look in my eyes, Sharona
Keeping it a mystery gets to me
Running down the length of my thighs, Sharona

Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind
I always get it up for the touch of the younger kind
My, my, my, I, yi, woo!
M-m-m-my Sharona
M-m-m-my Sharona


When you gonna give to me, g-give to me?
Is it just a matter of time, Sharona?
Is it j-just destiny, d-destiny
Or is it just a game in my mind, Sharona?

Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind
I always get it up for the touch of the younger kind

Yeah
One, two princes kneel before you
That's what I said now
Princes, princes who adore you
Just go ahead now
One has diamonds in his pockets
And that's some bread now
This one said he wants to buy you rockets
Ain't in his head now

This one, he got a princely racket
That's what I said now
Got some big seal upon his jacket
Ain't in his head now
You marry him, your father will condone you
How 'bout that now?
You marry me, your father will disown you
He'll eat his hat now

Marry him, or marry me
I'm the one that loves you, baby, can't you see?
I ain't got no future or family tree
But I know what a prince and lover ought to be
I know what a prince and lover ought to be

Said
If you want to call me ""baby""
Just go ahead now
And if you like to tell me ""maybe""
Just go ahead now
And if you wanna buy me flowers
Just go ahead now
And if you would like to talk for hours
Just go ahead now

Said
One, two princes kneel before you
That's what I said now
Princes, princes who adore you
Just go ahead now
One has diamonds in his pockets
And that's some bread now
This one who wants to buy you rockets
Ain't in his head now

Marry him, or marry me
I'm the one that loves you, baby, can't you see?
I ain't got no future or family tree
But I know what a prince and lover ought to be
I know what a prince and lover ought to be

Said
If you want to call me ""baby""
Just go ahead now
And if you would like to tell me ""maybe""
Just go ahead now
And if you wanna buy me flowers
Just go ahead now
And if you would like to talk for hours
Just go ahead now

And if you want to call me ""baby""
Just go ahead now
And if you would like to tell me ""maybe""
Just go ahead now
And if you would like to buy me flowers
Just go ahead now
And if you would like to talk for hours
Just go ahead now

If you want to call me ""baby""
Just go ahead now
And if you like to tell me ""maybe""
Just go ahead now
And if you want to buy me flowers
Just go ahead now
And if you like to talk for hours
Just go ahead now

Oh oh, baby!
Just go ahead now
Oh oh!
Just, just go ahead now
Just go ahead now
Oh, your majesty!
Just go ahead now
Come on, forget the King and marry me!
Just go ahead now
Come on, come on, come on
Just go ahead now
Go ahead now, yeah
Just go ahead now
And if you want to buy me flowers
Just go ahead now
Yeah just go ahead now baby
Just go ahead now"
