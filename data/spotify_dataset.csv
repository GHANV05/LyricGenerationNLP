I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough till we cross the line, hey-yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

Oh, baby, look what you started
The temperature's risin' in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waitin' and waitin' for you to make a move (Ooh)
Before I make a move (Ooh)

[Chorus]
So baby, come light me up
And baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous
But baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a
Little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us
So baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous
But baby, don't let them see it

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy (Enemy)
Your enemy (Your enemy), your enemy

If you get the chance, you better keep her (Keep her)
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer (Freezer)

Damn, I think I love her, shawty so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair (A fair)
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil' mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted

You promised me you'd be around

I took your words, and I believed
In everything you said to me
Yeah-huh, that's right

Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool?
Oh no, no, no

I know it breaks your heart

And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner

From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever gettin' older
