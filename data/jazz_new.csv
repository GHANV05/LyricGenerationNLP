In my solitude
You haunt me
With reveries
Of days gone by
In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm prayin'
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

I sit in my chair
Filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm prayin'
Dear Lord above
Send me back my love"

Simply because you're near me
Honey but when you're near me

Oh, is it any wonder

And it must rain, we'll let it

Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm going to treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, ""Julie Baby, you're my flame""

""Thou giveth fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yeah I burn, forsooth""

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him
She said, ""Daddy, oh don't you dare""

""He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his missus
Daddy won't you treat him right?""

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade

They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever, if you live you learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn

What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn"

And I will hear your voice
Resound in the silence
I'm gonna browse through my old scrapbook
Have a dry laugh at the way we looked
Hope for a hint that the wind
It's sending you back
But if you wanna go
Make it very quiet
Leave the door half-open

There's a saying old, says that love is blind

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he
Turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could
Always be good
To one who'll watch over me
Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him, please, to put on some speed
Follow my lead?
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me"

Lyrics“Can’t We Be Friends?” is a 1929 song with lyrics by Paul James and music by Kay Swift, introduced on Broadway in The Little Show by Libby Holman.
I thought I'd found the man of my dreams
Now it seems, this is how the story ends
He's going to turn me down and say
""Can't we be friends?""

I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
Not for long! I can see the way this ends
He's going to turn me down and say
""Can't we be friends?""

Never again, through with love
Through with men
They play their game without shame
And who's to blame?

I thought I'd found a man I could trust
What a bust, this is how the story ends
He's going to turn me down and say
""Can't we be friends?""

Yes, I thought I knew the wheat from the chaff
What a laugh, this is how our story ends
I'll let her turn me down and say
""Can't we be friends?"" (Scat)

I acted like a kid out of school
What a fool, now I see this is the end
I'll let her turn me down and say
""Can't we be friends?""

Oh, why should I care
Though she gave me the air?
Why should I cry
Ever sigh and wonder why? Yes

I should have seen the signal to stop
What a flop, this is how the story ends
She's gonna turn me down and say
""Can't we be friends?""

You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap

Those eyes, those sighs
They're part of the tender trap

You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart
Until your heart just goes wap
Those trees, that breeze
They're part of the tender trap

Some starry night
When her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight
And you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot
That's just a dot on the map
You're hooked, you're cooked
You're caught in the tender trap

Some starry night
When her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight
And you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

And then you wonder how it all came about
It's too late now, there's no getting out
You fell in love and love is the tender trap"

If you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind
If you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart, or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth
To be young at heart
For as rich as you are, it's much better by far
To be young at heart

And if you should survive to 105
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

Someday, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Oh, but you're lovely with your smile so warm
And your cheek so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
Just the way you look tonight

With each word, your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely, never, never change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? 'Cause I, I love you

Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo-Seltzer handy
I don't even shake
Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well, I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink
I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold, I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me
I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms
Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink
I've sinned a lot, I mean, a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking
He's at his very best
Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more
Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more
Couldn't eat, was dispeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there
Romance, finis; your chance, finis
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more"

Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potato
Give me the simple life

Not one that's spacious and wide
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside

Some like the high road, I like the low road
Free from the care and strife
Sounds corny and seedy but yes, indeedy
Give me the simple life


I greet the dawn when I awaken
The sky is clear up above
I like my scrambled eggs and bacon
Served by someone that I love
Life could be thrilling with one who's willing
To be a farmer's wife
Kids calling their Papi would make me happy
Give me, give me the simple life"

Autumn in New York is often mingled with pain
Dreamers with empty hands may sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

The gleaming rooftops at sundown
Autumn in New York
It lifts you up when you're let down
Jaded roués and gay divorcee who lunch at the Ritz
Will tell you that it's divine

Transforms the slums into Mayfair

On benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York

Steals across the meadows of my heart

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairytale
A paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain"

Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper, ""Please, adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
Without a love of my own
Without a love of my own"

I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me

Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""

I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you

The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""


The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""

""I love you""
""I love you""
""I love you""
""I love you"""

At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh, yeah, yeah

At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I've never known, oh, yeah, yeah

You smiled, you smiled
Oh, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last"
