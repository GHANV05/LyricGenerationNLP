Something in my body, something that's in my soul
Tells me you're somebody, someone I need to know
No, I can't leave here sorry, if I just let this go
Don't wanna hear my heart say, ""I told you so""

All day, all night, been looking all my life
Trying to find something new
Still lost, but I, I'll find my way tonight
And I know it's because of you

Eyes are on me, I can feel the fire
Not like anything that I've ever known
Might be the one and only chance I'll get with you
And I'll regret it if I take it too slow

Something in my body, something that's in my soul
Tells me you're somebody, someone I need to know
No, I can't leave here sorry, if I just let this go
Don't wanna hear my heart say, ""I told you so""

Don't wanna hear my heart say, ""I told you so""

Could run, could hide, but I won't sleep tonight
Wondering what did I lose? (Oh no)
I can't deny, no, when that feeling's right
I bet you'll feel the way I do

Oh, your eyes are on me, I can feel the fire
Not like anything that I've ever known
Might be the one and only chance I'll get with you
And I'll regret it if I take it too slow

Something in my body, something that's in my soul
Tells me you're somebody, someone I need to know
No, I can't leave here sorry, if I just let this go
Don't wanna hear my heart say, ""I told you so""

Don't wanna hear my heart say, ""I told you so""

Walls have fallen, heart is all in
This is what it feels like
Walls have fallen down
And you know I won't fight

I'm feeling something in my body, something that's in my soul
Tells me you're somebody, someone I need to know
No, I can't leave here sorry, if I just let this go
Don't wanna hear my heart say, ""I told you so"" (I told you so)

I told you, I, I, I told you so
I told you, I, I, I told you so

why couldn’t i take notice

An empty space, you walk right past me
You kiss my face, my skin is bruising

Looking back, am I just refusing the blame?
It's not what it seems, just win and defeat
Score's down by one and it's me vs me

Dig my grave six feet underneath the ground
We played our games, fucked around and found out
You go (I'll stay) behind the walls without a sound
No change (Today), forever, never around

We're losing this game, still feels the same
Looking back, am I just refusing the blame?
It's not what it seems, just win and defeat

Dig my grave, played the game (Hey)

Кх, вся банда нахуй

Слышь давай стреляться, белый
И со мной подъедет мандем (на нахуй)
У них отпадает челюсть, на проспекте моя банда
Ебали снитчей сколько помню, таких не бывает рядом (нахуй)
Если мы гоним по трассе, то любая тачка сзади (сзади)

716 - это дом, добавь нулей и я подумаю (Казань)
Я давно не юзал газ, но охуеют если дуну я
Пиздюки имеют фейм, но мой квартал так не думает (Нихуя ваще)
Че ща с индустрией? Нефоры чет напридумывали (Ай, ай)
Тут уважают старших
Возраст всегда имел смысл
Барыгу крутят на районе
Но он продолжает рыпаться (ее)
Наврал шлюхе про отель
И я повез ее в гостиницу
Тратить деньги на блядей
Бля, это бессмыслица
Хуй ты че сломаешь, то что я себе построил (не дам)
Мозг работает на сто даже когда я в режиме стонер
Если пальну им звук, ко мне обратиться промо
Прошу не еби мне мозг, вот те Михаила номер (ай, вот)

Если блять это услышат - значит всё пошло как надо (Ай)
Читает за мерсы, но не может позволить ладу (Ха-хаа)
Я в Котласе сейчас, подъезжай, с тобой побазарим (Подъезжай)
Вы вообще бублики с дыркой, как говорил Kizaru (Ае)
Trappin, trappin, trappin, trappin - это надо мне всегда (Надо)
Я всем dogger‘ам желаю, что б всегда была еда (Да)
Если сука нету денег - то знай, это не беда
Slime’ы всегда выберутся со дна (Ае)
Белый хотел денег, повёз в очке 2-2-8
Белый два пакета - твоя сука с нами, broskie (Ха-ааа)
Они меня тут знают, и я представляю Котлас (Котлас)
Я умнее блять тебя, че ты там мне сказал про возраст (Ай)
Я в этом движе давно, помню, как меня блять dox’или
Я думаю не хочешь, что бы мы с тебя спросили
Ну давай, попробуй, чё-то предъяви за волосы (Попробуй)
Даже когда буду старый, буду двигаться как в молодости
Мои G не суки, поэтому их не брошу бля (Еее)
Я пришёл на хату - доставай колпак и кроши бля (Доставай)
Ай, со мной не Al Capone - NO CAPONE нахуй (Артур)

'Cause it's the la-la-last time

You build me up, tear me down, take my heart
Twist it 'round, every word I believe, Mr. Lie To Me

Set my heart on fire
Pour gasoline all over my desire
When I go up in flames, I'm burning bright
I'll tell you it's too late to apologize

You burnt that bridge
A million times, a million tries
You play with fire

Every time we touch, my fingers burn
I just want that love, don't leave me hurt
I can feel the rush when we ignite
'Cause every time we touch
Every time we touch, I feel that fire


You know sparks gon' fly
Every time you look into my eyes
All it takes is one small match to light
'Cause once we feel the flame, we'll never die

You burnt that bridge
A million times, a million tries
You play with fire

Every time we touch, my fingers burn (Every time we touch)
I just want that love, don't leave me hurt
I can feel the rush when we ignite
'Cause every time we touch
Every time we touch, I feel that fire

Oh-oh
That love, don't leave me hurt

Every time we touch, my fingers burn
I just want that love, don't leave me hurt
I can feel the rush when we ignite
'Cause every time we touch
Every time we touch, I feel that fire"

We are never going home
We're the wild ones living on the go
You know that there is no rest for the wicked
I will show you if you come with me
Make you feel like it was all a dream
Imagine it's like heaven for a sinner

I can lead the way
Let me ease your pain
When the whole world is against you, I will carry you
Carry you away
Through the darkest days
When the whole world is against you, I will carry you
Carry you with me

Carry you with me
Carry you with me

Timе will never heal your scars
Might bе hard to fix a broken heart
But I can make you forget for a moment
What if this is all we'll ever have?
Make it count, don't hold onto the past
And we could light up the sky of tomorrow

I can lead the way
Let me ease your pain
When the whole world is against you, I will carry you
Carry you away
Through the darkest days
When the whole world is against you, I will carry you
Carry you with me

Carry you with me
Carry you with me
Carry you with me
Carry you with me

Carry you away
Through the darkest days
When the whole world is against you, I will carry you
Carry you with me"

If you ever run, run out of luck, run
Run into my arms when everyone's gone
I'll make you feel my love, feel my love, feel my love
I could never give, give, give it all up
'Cause you give me chills whenever we touch
I'll make you feel my love, feel my love, feel my love

Would you feel my love, feel my love?
Would you feel my love, feel my love?

I close my eyes, I hear you call
You're waiting on a miracle
I got you
Oh, I got you
I never asked to feel this way
And I can't take another day
Without you
Without you

If you еver run, run out of luck, run
Run into my arms when evеryone's gone
I'll make you feel my love, feel my love, feel my love
I could never give, give, give it all up
'Cause you give me chills whenever we touch
I'll make you feel my love, feel my love, feel my love

Feel my love
If you ever run, run out of luck, run
Run into my arms when everyone's gone
I'll make you feel my love, feel my love, feel my love

Feel my love, feel my love, feel my love
Feel my love, feel my love, feel my love
Feel my love, feel my love, feel my love
Would you feel my love, feel my love?"
