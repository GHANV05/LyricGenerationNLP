Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunkt, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

White heat is screamin' in the jungle (Oh, oh-oh)
Complete the motion if you stumble (Oh-oh)
Go ask the dust for any answers (Oh-oh)
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

This chapter's gonna be a close one (Oh, oh-oh)
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one (Oh-oh)
All on a spaceship, persevering (Oh-oh)
Use my hands for everything but steering

Can't stop the spirits when they need you (Oh, oh-oh)
Mop tops are happy when they feed you (Oh-oh)
J. Butterfly is in the treetop (Oh-oh)
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute, I'm passin' out, win or lose
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew
Right on cue


Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunkt, the pistol that you pay for (Oh, oh-oh)
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for (Oh-oh)
In time I want to be your best friend (Oh-oh)
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through"

I once heard in an interview
With some musician
That the trick was to imagine
The audience naked
I'm severely dyslexic
And get confused often
So instead I started imagining myself
Naked on stage
With everyone pointing and laughing
As I got older
And my drinking became more severe
That actually happened a whole bunch of times
Oooohhhhhhhh

When I write music
I want peoplе to feel
I want them to think
I want them to laugh
And to cry
Mostly I want them to soil thеir pants
Really the excretion of any bodily fluid
Preferably onto someone else
Mmmmhhhhmmmmm
Play it White Owl!

My friend Miguel is Hispanic
And I hate him for the way he treats me
Maybe that makes me Anti Semitic
I don't know
I'm a really creative person
I seem to be more creative when I'm drunk
I certainly drive more creatively
Oh!

I adhere pretty strictly
To the teachings of the honorable Elijah Muhammad
Peace be unto him
When you see those guys yelling on fourty second Street
If you see a white girl with blonde hair
Ranting about white devils
That's me
Na na
They forbid alcohol consumption
Of course
So I admit I cheat a little there
Also smoking
Drugs
Eating pork
And sleeping around are prohibited
I may not adhere completely to those either
To be honest
I'd love to be portrayed in a movie
Who would play me?
Would love to see it go to James Earl Jones
But he might be dead
Slappy White is probably dead
Maybe Woody Allen?
I dunno
Is he free yet?

Empty eyes, the fear within
Dust covers the sun
Screaming guns, nowhere to run
We sold our souls, the innocent die
The sky turns red, we don't know why
Marching to the sound of bombs
Evil minds in silent control
Blind servants, pull the trigger
Coward warlords point the finger
Desperation is what we've found
Our brother's underground
Machine guns, a deafening sound
A soldier falls, hitting the ground
Bullets fly, a life erased
A man is killed, nobody carеs
We sold our souls, the innocent cry
Thе sky turns red, we don't ask why
Marching to the sound of bombs
Evil minds in silent control
Blind servants, pull the trigger
Coward warlords point the finger
Desolation is what we've found
Our brother's underground
Machine guns, a deafening sound
A soldier falls, hitting the ground
A sea of eternal fear
A man erased, no one hears
We sold our souls, the innocent die
The sky turns red, we don't ask why
Broken cities, world on fire
The streets, a grave of fallen fighters
Cold wind howls, blood floods the hills
Merciless anger, bred to kill
The field is silent, no one has won
Graves remain where life is gone
I walk through corpses without names
The war is over, the guilt remains
Marching to the sound of bombs
Evil minds in silent control
Blind servants, pull the trigger
Coward warlords point the finger
Desolation is what we've found
Our brother's underground"

Saçım da soğuk bir rüzgar
Colitaların ılık kokusu
Gökyüzüne yükseliyor
Uzakta bir yerde
Parlak bir ışık gördüm
Kafam ağırlaştı ve görüşüm bulanıklaştı
Gece için durmam gerekti



Orda kapı yolunda duruyordu
Görev zilini duydum
Ve kendi kendime düşündüm

'Bu cennette olabilir, cehennem de'
Sonra kız bir mum yaktı
Ve bana yolu gösterdi
Koridorda sesler vardı
Sanırım şöyle dediklerini duydum



Hotel California'ya hoşgeldiniz
Çok sevimli bir yer (Çok sevimli bir yer)
Çok sevimli bir yüz
Hotel California'da çokça oda var
Senenin herhangi bir zamanı (senenin herhangi bir zamanı)
Burda bulabilirsin



Onun aklı mücеvherlerde
Onun Mеrcedes bends'i var
Arkadaş diye çağırdığı
Bir sürü tatlı erkek arkadaşları var
Sahne de nasıl dans ediyorlar
Tatlı yaz terinde
Bazı danslar hatırlanmak içindir
Bazı danslar unutmak



Kaptana seslendim
""Lütfen bana şarabımı getir""
""Biz de 1969'dan beri o içki yok"" dedi
Ve hala o sesler çok uzaklardan çağırıyor
Seni gecenin ortasında uyandırır
Sadece şunu duyman için



Hotel California'ya hoşgeldiniz
Çok sevimli bir yer (Çok sevimli bir yer)
Çok sevimli bir yüz
Hotel California'da yaşıyorlar
Ne güzel bir süpriz (ne güzel bir süpriz)
Bahanelerinizi getirin



Tavan da aynalar
Buzda büyük pembe şampanya
Ve o dedi ki ""Burada hepimiz sadece kendimizin tutsağız""
Ve ana salonda
Ziyafet için toplandılar
Onu çelik bıçaklarıyla doğradılar
Ama canavarı öldüremezler



Hatırladığım son şey
Kapıya koşutuğumdu
Daha önce olduğum yere giden
Geçidi tekrar bulmalıydım
""Sakinleş"" dedi adam
Varmak için programlandık
""İstediğin zaman çıkış yapabilirsin
Ama asla ayrılamazsın"""

Can you feel it, see it, hear it today?
If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway
You will never understand it, 'cause it happens too fast
And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass
It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright
It's so groovy, it's outta sight
You can touch it, smell it, taste it, so sweet
But it makes no difference 'cause it knocks you off your feet
You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

It's cryin', bleedin', lyin' on the floor

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there

Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication

It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication

Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station??
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there, and I don't mean on vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication


Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain’t no sound but the sound of his feet

Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?

Without you, when you’re gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own

How long can you stand the heat?

Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringin' me down
I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
So quit my whinin' 'cause it's bringin' her down

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up

Grasping to control

We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling-truck-Stones-thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what, we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water"

The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me

Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red, out of her head, she sang
Do do do do do do dododo

Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow, how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head, out of her head, she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
Do do do do do do dododo

Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now, I know you've always been
Out of your head, out of my head, I sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
So, dad would take the Sundays off
And that's the only time he could ever get any rest
And so, because we were loud on Sundays
He'd make us hold his construction boots over our head, 'til we'd sleep
And they were really heavy boots and I used to say, ""Dad, come on, please""
And like start crying, 'cause they're too heavy

And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when"

It starts with one

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

So you think you can love me and leave me to die?

Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

The boys and girls in the clique, the awful names that they stick
You're never gonna fit in much, kid
But if you're troubled and hurt, what you got under your shirt
Will make them pay for the things that they did

They said, ""All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed""
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me, oh, yeah


They said, ""All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed""
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
All together now

""Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed""
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
""Teenagers scare the living shit out of me

Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
End up like a dog that's been beat too much
'Til you spend half your life just coverin' up, now
Born in the U.S.A.​
I was born in the U.S.A.​
I was born in the U.S.A.​
Born in the U.S.A. now
Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man
Born in the U.S.A.​
I was born in the U.S.A.​
I was born in the U.S.A.​
I was born in the U.S.A.​

Come back home to the refinery
Hirin' man says, “Son, if it was up to me”
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said, “Son, don't you understand,” now

Oh yeah
No, no
No, no, no

I had a brother at Khe Sanh
Fightin' off them Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms, now
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burnin' down the road
Nowhere to run, ain't got nowhere to go
Born in the U.S.A.​
I was born in the U.S.A. now
Born in the U.S.A
I'm a long gone Daddy in the U.S.A. now

Never made it as a wise man

This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle

Scream, ""Are we havin' fun yet?""

Yet, yet, yet, no, no

It's not like you didn't know that

In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies

So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done, I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty

So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done, I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done


For what I've done, I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've

Done, I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself

Hit that, hit that snare

I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse

Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him right now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

I watched his wildest dreams come true
And not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving


Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now

Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now

I woke up, it was seven, I waited 'til eleven
Just to figure out that no one would call
I think I've got a lot of friends, but I don't hear from them
What's another night all alone?

When you're spending everyday on your own
And here it goes

I'm just a kid and all life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me tonight

And maybe when the night is dead, I'll crawl into my bed
I'm staring at these four walls again
I'll try to think about the last time I had a good time
Everyone's got somewhere to go

And they're gonna leave me here on my own
And here it goes

I'm just a kid and all life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me

What the hell is wrong with me? Don't fit in with anybody
How did this happen to me?
Wide awake, I'm bored and I can't fall asleep
And every night is the worst night ever

I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid (I'm just a kid)
Yeah, I'm just a kid (I'm just a kid)
And I'm just a kid (I'm just a kid)

I'm just a kid and all life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares 'cause I'm alone and the world is—
Nobody wants to be alone in the world
I'm just a kid and all life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares 'cause I'm alone and the world is—
Nobody wants to be alone in the world
Nobody cares 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me tonight

I'm all alone tonight
Nobody cares tonight
'Cause I'm just a kid tonight"

I miss you, I miss you

Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

I miss you, miss you
I miss you, miss you

Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stared, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)


Don't waste your time on me, you're already
