There's a nail in the door
And there's glass on the lawn
Tacks on the floor and the TV is on
And I always sleep with my guns
When you're gone
There's a blade by the bed
And a phone in my hand
A dog on the floor, and some cash on the nightstand
When I'm all alone the dreaming stops
And I just can't stand

What should I do, I'm just a little baby
What if the lights go out and maybe
And then the wind just starts to moan
Outside the door and followed me home
Well goodnight moon, I want the sun
If it's not here soon I might be done
No, it won't be too soon 'til I say
Goodnight moon

There's a shark in the pool
And a witch in the tree
A crazy old neighbor and he's been watching me
And there's footsteps loud and strong coming down the hall
Something's under the bed
Now it's out in the hedge
There's a big black crow sitting on my window ledge
And I hear something scratching through the wall

Oh what should I do, I'm just a little baby
What if the lights go out and maybe
I just hate to be all alone
Outside the door it followed me home
Now goodnight moon
I want the sun
If it's not here soon I might be done
No, it won't be too soon 'til I say
Goodnight moon

Well you're up so high
How can you save me
When the dark comes here tonight to take
Out my front walk
And into bed where it kisses my face
And eats my head

What should I do, I'm just a little baby
What if the lights go out and maybe
And then the wind just starts to moan
Outside my door it followed me home
Now goodnight moon
I want the sun
If it's not here soon I might be done
No, it won't be too soon 'til I say
Goodnight moon
No, it won't be too soon 'til I say
Goodnight moon"

Hold the earth above me
Lay down in the green grass
Remember when you loved me
Come closer don't be shy
Stand beneath a rainy sky
The moon is over the rise
Think of me as a train goes by
Clear the thistles and brambles
Whistle 'Didn't He Ramble'
Now there's a bubble of me
And it's floating in thee
Stand in the shade of me
Things are now made of me
The weather vane will say
It smells like rain today
God took the stars and he tossed them
Can't tell the birds from the blossoms
You'll never be free of me
He'll make a tree from me
Don't say good bye to me
Describe the sky to me
And if the sky falls, mark my words
We'll catch mocking birds

Lay your head where my heart used to be
Hold the earth above me
Lay down in the green grass
Remember when you loved me
Remember when you loved me

Remember those walls I built?
Baby, they're tumbling down
They didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make up a sound

But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget to pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

Visit her folks
And she ain't wanted me to go
So I stayed here
You know how they talk about a woman having that glow?
She didn't have it no more
She done cut it out
Got rid of it

Every time I think it's gone
It comes howling back

Calls me when I'm ailing
When I can't find my way home
Lost in the pines
I calls it the Black Snake Moan

Now summer's parade quietly fades on a reel
And I pulled down the lights from every last tiny limb

Not hiding, no, we are unashamed
Or running, not running, we are unafraid

Come take him by his feet
And throw him in this deep deep well

Stranded in this spooky town
Stop lights are swaying and the phone lines are down
Floor is crackling cold
She took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun

Driven by the strangle of vein
Showing no mercy, I'd do it again
Open up your eyes
You keep on crying, baby, I'll bleed you dry
Skies, they blink at me
I see a storm bubbling up from the sea

And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer

You shimmy shook my boat
Leaving me stranded all in love on my own
Do you think of me?
Where am I now? Baby, where do I sleep?
Feels so good, but I'm old
Two thousand years of chasing taking it's toll

And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer

Passing silhouettes of strange illuminated mannequins
Shall I stay here at the zoo? Or should I go
And change my point of view for every ugly scene?

My lover's got humour
He's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped him sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
He's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
'We were born sick,' you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
He tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you—
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

A, amen
Amen
Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
To drain the whole sea, get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean

A, amen
Amen
Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

Who needs a captain on a lover's ship?
Someone with no clue of the destination due, well
Ain’t that a trip?
Who needs a diamond on a hand of stone?
Someone with a hurt who couldn’t make it work
A trophy because you slipped

Love can’t conquer anything
If it’s lost without a trace
You might be tough, you might even be strong
But not when you’re in this place

Secret lovers, get lost in the secrets they tell
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
Secret lovers, it’s just your place or mine
A smoke and some wine is the life of the Black Valentine

Who needs a journey on a runaway train?
Your ticket isn’t worth half of what it hurts
When heart beats overwork
Who needs redemption from a guiltless crime?
Someone carries dreams from scream to scream
Til they tear apart your mind

Love can’t conquer anything
If it’s hurting in the deep
You’ll be awake, you’ll twist your fate
That’s not someone you should keep

Secret lovers, get lost in the secrets they tell
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
Secret lovers, it’s just your place or mine
A smoke and some wine is the life of the Black Valentine

This is their lament for another night they've spend in self-conversation
It’s a will they can't oppose in a letter left they’ve composed
To repeat the situation
They lie in a loop

Secret lovers, get lost in the secrets they tell
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
Secret lovers, it’s just your place or mine
A smoke and some wine is the life of the Black Valentine"

They used to tell me
That I can't stop / That I can't dream
That I can't fuck 'til I'm eighteen
That I came pop 'cause my hooks're clean
Cause my voice hurt and my words mean
That I am thirsty, that I'm crazy
That I am made to
Be a voice they
Wanted me to hated them cause I hated me

Feeling so good, feeling so gone, feeling fucked up right now
Gotta go soon, gotta go home, gotta get back to town
I don't want to be all alone anymore

There is trouble and trouble and trouble inside me
I don't want, I don't want to fight it
My women will take care of that
(She will)
There is trouble and trouble and trouble inside me
I don't want, I don't want to fight it
My women will take care of that

Would you believe in her
Like she believed in you
When she stayed
Would you believe in her
Like she believed in you
When she stayed

Yeah
I made it with my own lessons
I came from the bottom just to let it burn to ashes
Calm like a bomb, my voice is ugly like the guy behind it
Too many pain in my heart, not enough drugs to hide it
And I'll be rappin' like a mothafucka
Blood in my eyes, like I am staring at the stars above her
And I'll keep throwing her my sad songs
Until she finally come back here to save her son

And I know a woman somewhere

And I know a woman somewhere"

I am a creature of habit
And I move in circles around you
I will admit there's a pattern
One I've created myself
'Cause none of my lovers dared leave me
I grew impatient and stale
Didn't look back once I'd left them
'Cause I always expected to fail

But this time it's different
The rules don't apply
But I need some distance to step out of line

So grant me this wish and meet me back here in a year
If we still exist, I can let go of my fear
Fear of normalcy
Fear of the solid walls of our future and let go of my past

I must be crazy to want this
'Cause you are the girl of my dreams
But I'm prone to ruin the good things
Cautious 'round balance it seems

But with you it is different
The rules don't apply
But I need some distance to step out of line

So grant me this wish and meet me back here in a year
If we still exist, I can let go of my fear
Fear of normalcy
Fear of the solid walls of our future and let go of my past

Kindness in your eyes
I guess you heard me cry
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
I'm blessed
I know Heaven sent and Heaven stole
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
And what have I learned from all this pain
I thought I never feel the same about anyone
Or anything again
But now I know

When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

Sadness in my eyes
No one guessed and no one tried
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
Loveless and cold
With your last breath, you saved my soul
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
And what have I learned from all these tears?
I've waited for you all those years
Then just when it began
He took your love away
But I still say

When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

So the words you could not say
I'll sing them for you
And the love we would have made
I'll make it for two
For every single memory
Has become a part of me
You will always be
My love
Well, I've been loved so I know just what love is
And the lover that I kissed
Is always by my side
Oh, the lover I still miss

Beautiful little fools
That's what us girls are destined for
Beautiful little fools
Born to be adored

Where is the feminine race?
Where are these so-called independent women?
Who pick up their flaws
And let the world in
Where are these girls?

Beautiful little fools
That's what us girls are destined for
Beautiful little fools
Born to be adored

Most of these girls pick up her brush
They might not like art, but their face is a canvas
Designing something that is not their reflection
Becoming a beautiful little Hollywood perception

Beautiful little fools
That's what us girls are destined for
Beautiful little fools
Born to be adored

Didn't your mother ever tell you, ""Love yourself""?
Well if your mother was Zelda or Daisy, I guess not
Why can't you be a beautiful little girl
Instead of being a beautiful little fool?
I guess we're all just beautiful little girls
Playing a game of being fooled, yeah

Beautiful little fools
That's what us girls are destined for
Beautiful little fools
Born to be adored

Beautiful little fools, no
We're all just born to be adored
We're beautiful little fools
We're all just born to be adored"

I set a fire to the moon's shape
We are just shadows in the cascades of history
Fetid love and then your war games
A sky released
I set our bodies on my lungs' shore
This heavy whisper makes me more scared than anything
I was loved and now that love's lost
I know they'll never find us
Way out amongst the madness

I feel free in time
Fall depths with me miles apart
In light, we solve our whole lives
In time, you breach the brighter parts
Alight, we fall

You pry me thumping from this long drop
My twisted body in a bind that you want to break
This house is covered by your bloodsport
Don't give a fuck what's taken
I hear there's wars worth making

I just leave in time
Fall depths with me miles apart
In light, we solve our whole lives
In time, you breach the brighter parts
Alight, we fall

So lay down our lips
All our mumbles, they are fabled
Bind it all up, and cast it all out into the light
And I sense all your omens
You are young, you are able
We drop from the sky
And fill our lungs to feel alive

In time
Fall depths with me miles apart
In light, we solve our whole lives
In time, you breach the brighter parts
Alight, we fall

In time
Fall depths with me miles apart
In light, we solve our whole lives
Oh in time, oh in time, you breach the brighter parts
Alight, we fall

This haze is our enemy
Two facts enfold my heart and stone
Nobody knows

When the winter's a lie and the forces fall
Will a silent you bring me home?
When the winter's alive and the forces form in me
I'll offset your tomb and pull you from the sea

Porcelain tide, nobody move
These phantoms and wolfish dreams
All turn to white with leaded lungs
Can you see the light twisting?

When the winter's a lie and the forces fall
Will a silent you bring me home?
When the winter's alive and the forces form in me
I'll offset your tomb and pull you from the sea

And you fall hard apart
This moonlight drowns you
And you fall miles apart
What love will solve?

When the winter's a lie and the forces fall
Will a silent you bring me home?
When the winter's alive and the forces form in me
I'll offset your tomb and pull you from the sea
When the winter's a lie and the forces fall

From the sea, fall in me

Throw it all away to taste it

And for the taste, he’ll chase it

His father tells him it's dangerous
That’s the risk that he takes, though
When he pushes his limits

This is brotherhood, 512
We all lost a brother, won’t lose two
Above money, above fame
Above love, give me truth
This is coming home drunk and sick, late night shit
Wanna punch the wall and break lights in
This is patience wearing thin
When I have it all and no one to share it with
No one to share it with
Swear to God I'm sick

Yeah, when it’s all said and done
And when the wolves return to hunt (oh)
And for the taste, he’ll chase it
Throw it all away to taste it

Stumble around, thinking out loud
That’s the way I’ve been feeling
And I know this heart still needs healing
Sticking around, out on the town

I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

Ooh

It's a sad song that has no end
It's a bleeding heart that never mends
A minor miracle we can still pretend
After so long
And did the apple fall too far from the tree?
And id we get lost in the space in-between?
But the roots that we buried so deep
Will always be strong

Too late for lullabies, too soon for it alright
Love takes its toll sometimes
Let's start a clean slate, mistakes are moments in time
For every time you ever raised up your hand
I'll give you mine to show you I understand
You taught me to fly by learning to fall
Oh, yeah

Love burns when it's in the blood
And God knows I burnt you the best I could
How can three words be so misunderstood?
We got it so wrong
Yeah, the greatest gift that you ever gave to me
You don't know your strength till you've faced defeat
So when everything's just out of reach
You keep holding on

Too late for lullabies, too soon for it alright

Let's start a clean slate, mistakes are moments in time
For every time you ever raised up your hand
I'll give you mine to show you I understand
You taught me to fly by learning to fall

We built a brick wall, but it's all for nothing
Only bridges will cross this divide
We both know this road leads to nowhere
There's nothing left for you to hide

Too late for lullabies, too soon for it alright
But love takes its toll sometimes

To turn the hourglass

Sail away on teary seas
Tattooed the times we had, on my memory

When i close my eyes i see you
The dimples in your cheeks
I forgot to thank you for things
Cos i hadn't seen you in weeks
Woke up this morning
And hoped for a dream
But reality sat next to me
And forced me to believe
Knocked down too soon
Like a skittle on the lanes
The man took the wrong stop
From lifes's fast moving train

Goodbye sweet angel
Sail away on teary seas
Tattooed the times we had, on my memory

Funeral flowers, won't make me believe
They can carry out your casket
And i'll still expected see, you, you
Come round tomorrow
And tell me all your news
I don't ask for much from you
Sleep to my lullaby

Vamos a decirnos la verdad
En tu corazón no tengo lugar
Para qué me abres la puerta
Si luego no me invitas a pasar

Me haces sentir bien
Yo no sé porqué
Me gusta jugar
Así voy a perder

Egoísta, el amor que me das
Y luego me lo quitas
Egoísta, y me vuelvo a quedar
Creyendo en tus mentiras
Y no hay, no hay solución
No hay vuelta atrás
Yo no me puedo enamorar
Egoísta

Vamos a decirnos la verdad
Este juego siempre acaba igual
Ya no me divierte volver a quererte y dejarte ir
Siempre y cuando tu quieras

Me haces sentir bien
Yo no sé porqué
Me gusta jugar
Así voy a perder

Egoísta, el amor que me das
Y luego me lo quitas
Egoísta, y me vuelvo a quedar
Creyendo en tus mentiras
Y no hay, no hay solución

Oh, I need love the most
But it never stays long
A notch to my bedpost
Pretend they're mine

Sundress wrinkled on the floor
I'm naked, you're not here no more
To keep me warm, keep me warm
Crack the door with a trash bin
Maybe you will come back in
And keep me warm, keep me warm

My love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love
Pour the salt in the wound
My love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love
Pour the salt in the wound

Just hanging on the phone
Wishing it's too good to be true
Just me and my lonesome
Ashes on the tray long overdue

For me to pry myself away
From nonchalant toying games
Won't keep me warm, keep me warm
Crack the door with a trash bin
Maybe you will come back in
And keep me warm, keep me warm

My love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love
Pour the salt in the wound

Oh, life is bigger, bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
But I don't know if I can do it, do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Just a dream

Every whisper, every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this
The slip that brought me to my knees
What if all these fantasies come flailing around?
Now I've said, too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream, just a dream
Dream

That was just a dream

That's me in the corner

Trying to keep an eye on you

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard a mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
There's plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year
You can find it here""

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she's got the Mercedes Bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain, said ""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise
Bring your alibis""

Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice
She said: ""We are all just prisoners here of our own device""
In the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man, ""We are programmed to receive
You can checkout any time you like, but you can never leave!"""

Not hungry now but in a while I think that all could change
Used to feel so much that it would ache

I needed true care
When I was 17

How do you even show?
I needed true care
When I was 23 years old
You show me true care then
When you showed up to a house
Where I was drinking by myself
By the door
Spilling liquid on a carpet
That belonged to someone
I didn't even know
Or care about
Or want to show
My vivid mind
Or tragic dancing

And on my brightest days
Still duller than your darkest days
Impossible for me to say
How anyone
Deserves your true care
I'm uncomfortable
With being so uncomfortable
You let me be unreasonable

Show me true care

Deserves your true care

To be near you for a while
There's a crane knocking down
All these things that we were

Hear the engines pout
There's a pain it does ripple
Through my frame makes me lame
There's a thorn in my side
It's the shape it's the prize
Of you and me ever changing
Moving on now moving fast
And this touch must be wanting
Must become free to act
But I mean Jake to tell you
That I love you and never rests
And I bled everyday now
For a year for a year
I did send you a note
On the wind for to read
Our names there together
Must've fallen like the sea
To the depths of the soil
Buried deep in the ground
On the wind I can hear you
Call my name held the sound
I am lost
I am lost in a rainbow
Now our rainbow is gone
I am lost in a rainbow
Now our rainbow is gone
I am lost, I am lost

When things run smooth?

Is not yet in league
With the rest of the world
And it's little intrigues
Do you understand?
Do you know what she means?
As time goes by
And when you've seen what she’s seen
You will

Why does she have to defend
Her feelings inside?
Why pretend
She's not had a life
A life of near misses
Now all that she wants
Is 3 little wishes
She wants to see with your eyes
She wants to smile with your smile
She wants a nice surprise
Every once in a while
She wants to see with your eyes
She wants to smile with your smile
She wants a nice surprise
Every once in a while

And I, I tread a troubled track

And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rollin' up the walls inside

Act like an earthquake didn't come right in and tear it up
And everything we've built inside this beautiful and safe space
Here in this room where you should be

A stranger simply passing through again, again, again

They're not supposed to break so fast
They say that time's a healer
How long's this burn supposed to last?

Too proud to say it, and I let you leave straight out of spite
And now I'm missing you, sometimes I wish you miss me too
Maybe you do, I'm hoping, but you're too proud to say it too
Maybe I've just been dreaming, dreaming that you'll come right back again, again, again

Hearts aren't supposed to hurt like that
They're not supposed to break so fast
They say that time's a healer
How long's this burn supposed to last?

If I could ask a smoking gun, how it feels to hurt someone
I would just ask you
If I could ask someone I love, how it feels to lose someone
I would just ask you
If I could ask a smoking gun, how it feels to hurt someone

There are ten thousand roads to run away

But I am not lost, I am not found
I am not Dylan’s wife, not Cohen’s hound
But if I be wrong, if I be right
Let me be here with you tonight

And what if I can’t, what if I can
What if I’m just an ordinary man
If there is a will, there is a way
I will escape for sure, I am David Blaine
But if I be wrong, if I be right
Let me be here with you

Rushing and played by

To shatter the buildings and throw out the line

Searching searching for

Western questions, villages moving, the visitors settling in
Drifters, grifters, spanning sifters looking for a flash in the pan
International witness protection through mass migration
The imminent surrender of land
Cloaked in safety at the counter of a luxury liner with a noose in my hand

Dislocated relocations
Bermuda Triangle tours
A disappearance of a floating cathedral into the sewer
Let the slime come, the gelatinous walls of the seeds that seldom remain
While the bulls are browsin' needles through computer casinos
Honor the name

Stationed agents, operators, slumlords, engineers
Factor in ghettos and stack up the green paper walls for the man of the year
I'm the hero of the human highway
I'm the savior of the ethnosphere
Overdue by assassination, promoting racial vaccination and fear

Hollywood halo, the UFO light oozing from every screen
Western questions, desperate elections, campaign Halloween
We relax with our love life published, slip into something obscene
We got slime and flamingos, take the number but please don't forget about me

Dislocated relocations
Bermuda Triangle tours
A disappearance of a floating cathedral into the sewer
Let the slime come, the gelatinous walls of the seeds that seldom remain
While the bulls are browsin' needles through computer casinos
Honor the name"

And I lose you to the crowd

Fueled by desire
Far below
Who are we
To turn a blind eye to the truth?
And I could cross the wire
Risk the fall
Win the kill
But I want it all with you
So if time can heal the pain
Oh it leaves me wondering

Too much gray today
I have to take my heart away from you
I need a night to breathe
You didn't bend my wings
You bit them off with your teeth
Now I can only fly when I'm with you

Could I be both under our common ground?
I am lost, I am found
Could I be both under our common ground?

Covered in fantasies
Who was I before he invaded my mind, made the voices leave quietly?
Whenever he pulls me deeper into his dream
I can't remember if I have control or does he?
Beat me to it, I hope so
Beat me to it
Beat me to it, I hope so
Beat me to it

I felt the surge today, almost forgot my name
Keep my mouth shut, keep my clothes unbuttoned
Should I stay on this train?
I don't know what to say
To the man who makes my love darker everyday

I am found
Could I be both under our common ground?
I am lost, and I am found
Could I be both under our common ground?

Who was I before he invaded my mind, made the voices leave quietly?
Whenever he pulls me deeper into his dream
I can't remember if I have control or does he?

I can feel it already
He's breaking under me
We are lost
We are lust
We may have found someone to trust
We are lost
We are lust
We may have found someone to trust

Could I be both under our common ground?

Then you know what I mean

Before I met you myself

Have never kissed you on the mouth

So I don't visit you that often
But I live with
The knowledge of your smile

But if you've walked through those fields
Then you know what I mean
Where are you the rest of the time?
And why do eyes grow tired?
And I can't forget the night
That you stabbed me in the back
So I live a reasonable life
But I never forget

Showed me an open hand

What a journey so hard to describe
Your harbour so small the ocean so wide
Spin the wheel, spin the wheel go wherever she spins
Surrender to this wave that's rolling in
Homing fingers starting to dig
Raising expectations lifting the lid
There's a show going down going deeper within
I long to lose myself inside your skin

What a feeling under the stars
My body's rotating from venus through mars
There's a war going on between my head and my heart
I wonder how they grew so far apart
I'm so shaken, about to explode
The myth of kissing princes as they turn into toads
There's a war going on between the sun and the moon
Before they come to terms we'll be consumed

Oh my god, please take me now
I'm ready for ascension if I only knew how
Give me wings give me wings now I'm stuck on the ground
Recieve this blood and bones I'm homeward bound

See the statue growing wings
This singer was a virgin until he conceived
God is love, god is love and her lover I'll be
I long to leave the world in ecstacy
Dance with me around this fire
The dance of bad angels who'd love to fly higher
God is love, god is love and her lover I'll be

We can remember swimmin' in December
Headin' for the city lights in 1975
We're sharin' each other, nearer than farther
The scent of a lemon drips from your eyes

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

We lived an adventure, love in the summer
Followed the sun 'til night, reminiscing other times of life
For each every other the feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven, we got lost in your eyes

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believin' now?
I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believin' now?

Can you remember and humanize?
It was still where we'd energize
Lie in the sand and visualize like it's '75 again

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believin' now?
I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believin' now?

I know everything about you
Know everything about me
Know everything about us
I know everything about you
Know everything about me
Know everything about us

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believin' now?
I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me

You'll find my text in thе 14th chapter of St. Luke  and at the 54th vеrse. The words of the text:
""And he sat with the servants, and warmed himself by the fire.""
Subject: warming by the devil's fire.
Ah, my friend, I wanna impress upon your mind tonight, uh, the callous and unconcerned Christian who always taking . I think it's a sin and a shame, the way so many Christians who said they been born again, and they'll do anything and they'll say anything and they'll go anywhere, and then trying to convince me that you been born again. I declare to you tonight that I think that everyone that is born again ought to let your light shine. You ought to be careful 'bout— you ought to be careful how you talk, how you act, and then be careful about the company you keeping. So many people that's going 'round here come out there sinning. Th— there's no doubt in my mind about you being sent. But the question is, who sent you? Everybody that's said they're sent to preach the good word of God, they haven't been sent by my Lord, because when you've been sent by the Lord, it makes you act right, it makes you live right. And then, I declare to you tonight, I think it's a shame, going 'round here, drinking more whiskey than sinners, doing things that a hypocrite and sinner's gon' do, then trying to lead somebody. You got to get right yourself before you can lead anybody else. The blind can't lead the blind,  the blind lead the blind, they both fall in a ditch. Before your shine'll lead somebody else right, you get right yourself, then when you get right, then you can tell others to get right. If I were you tonight, I'd stop warming by the devil's fire.

Places I used to go, I don't go no more

In this shirt I can be you
To be near you for a while
There's a crane knocking down
All these things that we were
I awake in the night to
Hear the engines pout
There's a pain it does ripple
Through my frame makes me lame
There's a thorn in my side
It's the shape it's the prize
Of you and me ever changing
Moving on now moving fast
And this touch must be wanting
Must become free to act
But I mean Jake to tell you
That I love you and never rests
And I bled everyday now
For a year for a year
I did send you a note
On the wind for to read
Our names there together
Must've fallen like the sea
To the depths of the soil
Buried deep in the ground
On the wind I can hear you
Call my name held the sound
I am lost
I am lost in a rainbow
Now our rainbow is gone
I am lost in a rainbow
Now our rainbow is gone
I am lost, I am lost
I am lost, I am lost
I am lost"

All of the things that we said
They didn't seem wrong at that time
Hold on a while

And that same look in your eyes
Now baby, let's give this a chance
Hold on a while

Hold on a while
Forget everything I'm gonna say
Now baby, I don't wanna fight
Hold on a while

I think tomorrow will change
Everything we did wrong
Now honey, let's put things aside
And hold on a while

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
""What's going on?""

And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said ""Hey, a-what's going on?""
And I say, hey-ey-ey

Ooh, ooh

Ooh, uh huh
Ooh, ooh

Ooh, uh huh

And I try
Oh my God, do I try
I try all the time
In this institution
And I pray
Oh my God, do I pray
I pray every single day
For revolution

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
""What's going on?""

I had a dream that all of time was running dry
And life was like a comet falling from the sky
I woke so frightened in the dawning, oh so clear
How precious is the time we have here

Are we not wise enough to give all we are?
Surely we're bright enough to outshine the stars
The human kind gets so lost in finding its way
But we have a chance to make a difference til our dying day

And you might pray to God
Or say it's Destiny
But I think we are just hiding
All that we can be

Are we not wise enough to give all we are?
Surely we're bright enough to outshine the stars
The human kind gets so lost in finding its way
But we have a chance to make a difference til our dying day

All I'm really asking is: what are we doing here?
Are we just killing time? Just living year to year?
In this big world, no one else can play our part
Ain't it time to just wake up and give it all

Are we not wise enough to give all we are?
Surely we're bright enough to outshine the stars
The human kind gets so lost, and in finding its way
We have a chance to make a difference til our dying day

Hi my name is Carmen Winstead
I'm 17 years old
I am very similar to you
Did I mention to you that I'm dead?
A few years ago a group of girls pushed me down a sewer hole to try and embarrass me
When I didn't come back up the police came
The girl said that I had fell and everyone believed them
The police found my body in the sewer
I had a broken neck and my face was torn off
Send this message to 15 peoplе after you listened thе whole message if you value your life
A boy called David received this message
He just left and deleted it
When he was in the shower he heard laughing
My laughter. He got really scared and rushed to his phone to repost this message but he was too late
The next morning his mom entered his bedroom and all she found was a message written in his blood saying 'You will never have him back'
No one has found his body yet because he is with me
A girl called Charlotte received this message and she immediately sent it to 25 people, 10 more than required
I still watch over every second of her life to make sure that she is safe and to keep her and everyone close to her out of danger
Send this to 15 people in the next five minutes if you don't want your fate to be the same as David's
Your time starts now
The story is true you can research it on Google"

To be someone I'd never be?

Everyone but me
But I know you truly saw me

Maybe that's why it hurts now
To leave it all behind

Well, a goodbye never seems finished
Just like these songs that I write
They hang aloft like stars in the night
But there's nothing there but the illusion of a light
And you, you could've been mine

And we're all putting on a play
Here's some conviction, pretend it's all real
Try to ignore how sad it all feels
Yes, try not to break her heart, if you can

Hold on to whatever you can until it's gone
Carry on, for none of us will be here for too long

I'll try not to let the world
And its darkness bring me down
Think of the love and the beauty I've found
The simple things that I've left behind
Oh the way he'd make me laugh

But I'll hold on to whatever I can until it's gone
I'll carry on, for none of us will be here for too long

You're a distant star
But darling, you're so far away
You were never meant to stay
I reach out to see
If you're still here with me
Babe, we could've made it easy
Couldn't we?

Now I will never know you
You were just someone passing by
And it makes me sad to think about
All the stories and fates I'll be without
But I think I'm getting used to the silence now"

While this town is busy sleeping
All the noise has died away
I walk the streets to stop my weeping
'Cause she'll never change her ways

But don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
Ah, my heart feels so still as I try to find the will
To forget her somehow
Oh, I think I've forgotten her now

Her love is a rose, pale and dying
Dropping her petals in land unknown
All full of wine, the world before her
Was sober with no place to go
Mmm

Don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
My heart is frozen still as I try to find the will
To forget her somehow
She's somewhere out there now


Well, my tears falling down as I try to forget
Her love was a joke from the day that we met
All of the words, all of her men
All of my pain when I think back to when
Remember her hair as it shone in the sun
The smell of the bed when I knew what she'd done
Tell yourself over and over you won't ever need her again

But don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
Oh, my heart is frozen still as I try to find the will
To forget her somehow
She's out there somewhere now

Oh, she was heartache from the day that I first met her
My heart is frozen still as I try to find the will
To forget you somehow
'Cause I know you're somewhere out there right now
I don't wanna ban her
Oh, oh, oh, oh"

Good or bad?
The way that things did turn out
I did only make you sad
And we cried and we cried
On the phone
Oh, but in my mind
You were never that all alone

Oh, you were majesty
Your robes were heavy
And your longing was cut from bone

So am I
Am I good or bad?
Could only awake your anger
I could only make you mad
Now was that how you showed me
That you were still so young and bold
Anyway those fights did drive me
And I was dying of thirst and I wasn't growin' old

Oh, you were majesty
Your robes were heavy
And your roads were very cold
Oh, oh, oh majesty

But in my mind
I could still climb inside your bed
And I could be victorious
Still the only man to pass to the glorious arch of your head, o-oh

Oh, you were majesty
Your robes were heavy
And your cheeks very red
Oh, you were majesty
And it's like I said
That spirit, is now dead
Oh, oh, oh Majesty

You say you love me
But then you turn and walk away
All for love
Not even born yesterday
I see you on the streets
And you just pass me by
You think I got no feelings
Think I'm living high
But let me tell ya
I could be on the TV
I could be in them magazines
But it's never enough
When you felt the touch
Of an angel that's rocking your soul

When the rain comes down
You're never around
But when the sun comes up
You always steal the fire
And rain comes down
On this side of town
But people have no feelings
They just run around

They just, they just
We keep chasing dollars
It's making me holler
I just don't know
I don't need a check
I need some respect
So people you know
And the war
And the babies crying
And the car
And the house
And the rings
And the things that don't mean nothing
You could try to hate
Cause if I am right your right down
But I'm here to elevate
I'll be floating in outer space now

When the rain comes down
Will you be around?
When the sun comes up
Will you always steal my fire?
And rain comes down
On this side of town
But people have no feelings

You ask me to hold you and then you're not there

Where is the money and where is the time

Where is my pride where is my self respect
Does it serve any purpose to you

The fruit that's plucked from the bitter tree is rotten old
You can find that seed sown deep in me
As a child I was taught to fear if it ever grows
So I get on my knees with a daily plea

Swallow me down and your throat will surely burn
These are the lessons I was made to learn
As I age it gets harder to resist his call
I tread lightly for if I ever fall
The devil's gonna keep me

A new love's fascination burns straight through my core
You send shivers when you touch my skin
I don't have the will to fight you anymore
So I take a bite cause I've given in

Carry me high in your arms – a sweetened embrace
We breathe harder, faster, a rhythmic pace
As I lay tangled up with you we stay here cloaked
I hear a whisper as the silence spoke
The devil's gonna keep me

Blood stained hands don't ever wash clean, wash clean
I try desperately but the stains stay seen
The fruit has fully grown and I can't bear its weight
So I dread the judgment I await

Bury me six feet underground alive or dead
Nothing can stop my fate that lies ahead
The time has come to reap the life I leave behind
In the end my soul is reassigned
The devil's gonna keep me"

Iau cheile cu mine și le-arunc să nu mă-ntorc

Că eu nu plec pentru că nu te mai vreau
Eu plec pentru că nu mai pot să stau așa, cu tine, în lipsa ta

Știu c-o să mor de dorul tău

Și sufletul meu mut plânge acu', da' nu-l aude nimeni

Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and grey
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in a violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could've told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in their ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will"

You were at my door
I heard you knocking but I didn't care at all
I had been in all night just staring at the wall
I didn't really want to see you anymore

Coming from the road
You took your coat off and you threw it on the floor
You said ""I can't believe you wanna hurt me so""
I said ""I'm not supposed to be like this, you know""
Well, I just had to let you go

What's on your mind?
When you're lost in time
What's on your mind?
Tell me why
Why does it have to be this way?

You were in that dream that I was dreaming
I was dreaming in a dream
Your nylon dress and I was floating back downstream
I wanted love to come and swallow everything

Everything gets real
Sooner or later, doesn't matter how you feel
You slammed that door shut on the night of glass and steel
I cannot blame you for believing what you believe
Well, I just had to let you go

What's on your mind?
When you're lost in time
What's on your mind?
Tell me why
Why does it have to be this way?

Why do you always stay
Miles away
And two steps behind
Where the past is still living
Beautiful and forgiven
Do you not see
That you live in a dream
Hey

What's on your mind?
When you're lost in time

Just take me off life support

And I'd rather kill what I can't keep
When I beg for your pity
'Cause I want you as low as I

Just give it a stand

I've gotta stand 'bout my reason
Let the film roll without me

I'm always waitin' for what comes real
Knees break from bein' down
Seekin' a little love here and there
But I don't blame you for the end
That show the last, maybe myself for taking back

But it seems pointless to explain

Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something

I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker

She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh

Because I just can't stand it

I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep

Hail to the night
I will wait for your call
Expecting light
Of some form to be shed

Instead, I feel the weight of your heart
See how it sinks
Instead, I feel the weight of your stone blooded heart
See how it sinks

I say, ""Lover do
You remember this face?""
Four times amused and
Rhythms fall in your place

And can you feel the weight of my stone blooded heart?
See how it sinks
And can you feel the weight of my stone blooded heart?
See how it sinks

And I hope that someday
We can share
And I hope that someday
We can share the same ground again

In my mindless pursuit of happiness
You far from me, sleepwalking down the highway
But we know that's the life or the death of me
I can't contemplate the though of you without you without me

And I hope that someday we can share

Something's gonna rise

'Cause if you both got tired, yeah, long enough

Hoping that you're looking for a little bit more
Will you catch me, save me when I'm falling?

Find your courage, find your lion
And take your pride and leave the past
Set sail for new horizons
So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage and find your lion
And if you hear the angel sings

So many faces telling the story
Like once upon a time
Blinded by the force of falling in love or
Leaving it all behind.. but
The fear of the unknown, and who to follow
Leaves me howling at the skies

Is there a purpose in what we believe?
Well I will continue to wear my heart upon my sleeves

So take my hand and lead the way

And take your pride and leave the past
Set sail for new horizons
So take my hand and lead the way

When the streets are empty
When the streets are empty

That's what happens when I get lost in my mind
That's what happens when I get lost in my mind

Midnight sunshine, it's your smile, I'm going crazy
Spread the words I painted in red and follow the thread
We'll find our path, find our path
When we kiss it'll come to us
To us
It'll come to us

Don't get lost in your mind

Oh, don't get lost in your mind

Vivement le week-end
À cause de mon talent, j'suis convoqué chez les chickens, yeah
À Paris, y'a plus rien d'nickel
T'as déjà dit d'une meuf qu'elle est moche tah Sonia Rykiel
Sois l'bienvenu dans le système
Où les médias, la populace, n'aiment pas les filles saines
Mise de côté comme une ficelle
Au fait, c'est 'chant-mé' quand ton poto sort à mi-peine, yeah
À force de manger seul
Tu finiras par t'étouffer seul
T'es dépassé comme le Minitel
J'suis aussi amer que le Ministère
Paro, la vie, c'est nichen
Jusqu'au linceul, demande à Rafik ou bien Hichem
Tu m'dis que j'ai des milliers d'fans
Mais, dans mon cœur, moi, j'ai des millions d'thèmes
J'ai besoin de dollars
M'envie pas, j'envie les frères qui prennent le large
M'invite pas si tu sais pas manier le kalâm
Dévie pas, tu pourrais finir dans un polar, yeah
C'était la parenthèse minute peine
Y'en a même chez les militaires
Dounia m'envoie des e-mails
Et mon hymen finit dans le Finistère
Garde l'équilibre, la vie prend
La vie donne à tous et nous délivre
Le goût de vivre, c'est le monde qui raisonne-sonne
Le temps d'un rêve, le temps d'une chimère
Sois pas si naïf
Et pourquoi tu t'étonnes ?
Les roses finissent par s'incliner
Et, malgré ça, tu fais l'effort d'y croire encore, d'y croire encore

J'prends mon temps depuis l'départ
La roue tourne, mon ami, et chacun vit son quart d'heure
Mon futur à l'horizon
Et, à mi-chemin, y'a ma foi, ma raison
Désolé mais tu n'es plus dans l'coup
J'ai l'droit à l'or et au prix Goncourt
Car je crois qu'on a deux vies
Et, quand on dévie, un jour, on paye le devis
Moi, j'ai grandi dans la rue
Celle qui préfère se battre plutôt que d'attendre le mécène
J'suis pas une idole, issu d'la middle class LiDL
J'côtoie beaucoup de gens qui me limitent
Je dois me libérer de mes chaînes (de mes chaînes)

Garde l'équilibre, la vie prend
La vie donne à tous et nous délivre
Le goût de vivre, c'est le monde qui raisonne-sonne

Et, malgré ça, tu fais l'effort d'y croire encore, d'y croire encore
L'aventure humaine-maine te traîne, tu cours à en perdre haleine
Mais le voyage en vaut la peine
Même si l'issue est incertaine
Ça vaut la peine, ça vaut la peine

Je n'm'avouerai pas vaincu tant qu'mon dos n'aura pas touché l'sol

I can make you play
I can make you smile
I can make you safe in my foolish arms
You're my sweetest kiss
You're my immortality
You're my pretty world world
Spins inside my little mind little mind

Now we're kissing and we're saying to each other
Just a little ""I do""
But the thing is what I really want to say
It cannot be said
And I promise I will never let that death
Take you from me anyway ooh
I'll throw us stars stars stars
To wish we'll never die

You're my crystal sea
You're my loudest rhythm
Beats inside my heart

I will make you fly

Just an empty room filled with empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly 'til your next hello

Like no night has been or will be again

At first I was afraid, I was petrified
I kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights just thinkin' how you'd done me wrong
I grew strong, I learned how to get along
And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here without that look upon your face
I should have changed my fucking lock, I would have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Oh, now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around, now, you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, not I, I will survive, yeah
As a-long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
I will survive, I will survive, yeah, yeah


It took all the strength I had just not to fall apart
I'm trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me with somebody new
I'm not that stupid little person still in love with you
And so you thought you'd just drop by and you expect me to be free
But now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Oh, now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around, now, you're not welcome, anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, not I, I will survive, yeah
As a-long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
I will survive, I will survive, yeah, yeah

I'm going to a town that has already been burnt down
I'm going to a place that has already been disgraced
I'm gonna see some folks who have already been let down
I'm so tired of America

I'm gonna make it up for all of The Sunday Times
I'm gonna make it up for all of the nursery rhymes
They never really seem to want to tell the truth
I'm so tired of you, America

Making my own way home, ain't gonna be alone
I've got a life to lead, America
I've got a life to lead

Tell me, do you really think you go to hell for having loved?
Tell me, enough of thinking everything that you've done is good
I really need to know, after soaking the body of Jesus Christ in blood
I'm so tired of America

I really need to know
I may just never see you again, or might as well
You took advantage of a world that loved you well
I'm going to a town that has already been burnt down
I'm so tired of you, America

Making my own way home, ain't gonna be alone
I've got a life to lead, America

Underneath the grass would grow, aiming at the sky
It was swift, it was just another wave of a miracle
But no one, nothing at all would go for the kill
If they called on every soul in the land, on the moon
Only then would they know a blessing in disguise
The curse ruled from the underground down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live like before
The curse ruled from the underground down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live like before
Tell me now of the very souls that look alike, look alike
Do you know the stranglehold covering their eyes?

Tell me if I'll ever know a blessing in disguise

She's got a fire in her touch that can't be tamed
Wears her heart on her sleeve and her tears bring the rain
And if she loves you you'd never be the same
She'd love you and leave you just as fast as she came

She's hell on wheels, but she's heaven on Earth
She'll make you a man, she'll steal your heart
She'll love you like the devil and leave you in the night
Make everything wrong feel so right

She's got a devastating smile, and poison on her tongue
She's got a gypsy soul, and she won't stay long
And her voice, it is a siren's song
Yeah, her voice. it is a siren's song

She's hell on wheels, and she's heaven on Earth

Stop lights are swaying and the phone lines are down
Floor is crackling cold
She took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun

Driven by the strangle of vein
Showing no mercy, I'd do it again
Open up your eyes
You keep on crying, baby, I'll bleed you dry
Skies, they blink at me
I see a storm bubbling up from the sea

And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer

You shimmy shook my boat
Leaving me stranded all in love on my own
Do you think of me?
Where am I now? Baby, where do I sleep?
Feels so good, but I'm old
Two thousand years of chasing taking it's toll

And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer"

These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones


Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms"

The one that you claim as a hip-hop artist
But won't do the research on hip-hop history
Or the one where you disrespect, disconnect
And disregard the founding fathers?
But you know what? Whatever it is, it don't even matter
'Cause as long as I'm alive
I'ma show and prove where this culture came from
And what it's really all about
I got you, my nigga, yo, ayo

Count to ten and then come in shootin' (Yeah)
Fuck peace, Silverback the new Huey Newton (D-Block)
I feel it, it's in the air, white cop with a stare
New judge in the chair, this shit hittin' the fan (Woo)
But me, I'ma be smart and legalize my shit
And I ain't leavin' the house without that in my hand (Ahh)
And it ain't only the cops, it's niggas on your block (Uh-huh)
That talk like a lil' bitch and act like they your man

Somethin' like Kris Parker, my Uzi weigh a ton
Hundred niggas on the track, then you know I'll be the one
To tell niggas to suck cock, run and get a gun
It's old P, new P, prob'ly layin' in the sun
Prob'ly on a P.I., if I call you king
I ain't talkin' 'bout rap, nigga, that status go to B.I
You can fuck around and get burnt like a C.I
More bars than jail, nigga, who tryna get a V.I?

You dealing with stock owners, conversation with stockbrokers
Make a call for coco, smokin' dope from my crop grower
The block know us, kush got a funky sock odor
How could you not notice? I come from that rock culture (Rock)
Star of the squad but they cannot coach (At all)
Louis Vuitton holster, this for my niggas in the cell
And on they wall, they got a Nicki Minaj poster
The talk's over, no drive-by's, we walked over

COB bandana tied to the end of the AR
Iller than they are, rhymes so sick, give 'em the day off
This is the chaos, Nicolas Cage, face off
The dark knight, I make it a dark night when I'm gettin' that K off
Better than whoever done it, even officers better run it
With the drum, I got a technique that'll give twelve a hundred
Now the tables turn, to whom it may concern
I used to control more shooters than David Stern
With Lucifer, hater burn

Yo, I was in the park spray-painting on the platform
Patent leather top ten, Space Invader hats on
Eighty-something, I've been a threat for that long
Where a lot of people get poked up and clapped on
My job really putting on for the city
You get popped like a wheelie for saying some old silly shit
Tell me it'll be safer to say it in Swahili
They be wheeling you away if you say it in South Philly

Look, thirty shots, I'm shootin' to peel his top (Huh?)
When them niggas sending shots, they shootin' to get the spot
That I'm in, nigga (Hahaha)
You know what it is when I spin the block (Uh-huh)
Uppin' this Draco, the witness is still in shock (Brrr!)
Fluffin' a brick of this yayo, I tilt the pot (Whip)
Tuckin' this fifth, you play with me, you getting shot (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
Yeah, niggas still waiting for me to drop (Uh-huh)
I robbed niggas for they base and sold easy rock (Ha)

Fur coats and magnums
Come through the hall with the big blammers
Bentaygas parked, let me handle this
Jewelry that's flashy, jeans is a thousand, we slick nasty
Pull out a hundred in your housing
Yeah, it's raw lingo in a Kangol
Dutch lit, nuts big as shit, taste the rainbow (Ayo, yo!)
Put your paper up and threaten shit
Or tie something up, send some messages

Ayo, ayo, I used to tell a maid, ""Sunny side up""
Basement, a chainsaw, money tied up
Paper bag over his head, so  let the crocs out
Wave a whole chicken by his legs near the croc's mouth
Sweating bullets in the tip, blow torching his flesh
I seen his face melt, drip gooey shit on his chest
Watch this motherfucker beg for mercy
Shoulda let his wiz suck my dick for that time he jerked me

The soldier I rolls with the coldest clique
Call me prototype, never had a mold to fit
My clothes is dipped, my bros is lit
Only time you been sick is when the COVID hit
Better get in line, I chop the bass like I'm pitching dimes
Code name Coffee Bean how I hit the grind
Precision design, exquisite with the vivid shine
I'm like a European watch on a different time

I used to run around with a MAC-10
Back when I was 20 years old, that was back then (30)
30 clip in the 40, move yayo like 50
Man, I hustle like Nip in the Rolling 60s
I was born in the 70's, grew up in the 80's
Got the MAC-90, then I went crazy
Do the mathematics, y'all can't compete (100)
All by myself, I'm 100 deep

I was on the first 50, now the powers at a dollar
Politician pushing tracks in it, mayor, I president in it
Til it's humbling, think you grounded and get punished
This the second time Slay needed my two cents to keep it a hundred
How you want it? Fake and be a martyr for this matrix?
They gon turn up the AC then charge you for the blankets
Lux verse mean, got you stuck standing there
Like you at a stop sign waiting for it to turn green, what you mean?

My soul is never for sale
My youngin' just did a twelve, he home, he ringing bells
Wish him well, me and mines on different times
Decline from nigga crimes, I'm fine just spitting rhymes
Read the signs, body language is loud
Cowards hang with the crowd, I ain't never changing my style
Then and now, before that was all that
Fall back, official is what you call that

I be that Third Coast legend, Dirty South icon
Shuttin' shit down, soon as they cut my mic on
From the first bar down to the last syllable
Niggas that thought they were immortal find out they killable
Once I see blood, I'm like a Great White
Catch you slippin' on a late night and it's no bark, straight bite
Watch you bleed out as reality starts to sink in
You tried the Triple OG (Bitch) what was you thinking?

I give the coke to your crew, the butter's crazy
Fallopian tube, just cut it baby
Gordo butterfly collar cover the Cubans
She need pads like Ewing, I hope you know what you doin' (Look)
Some paid 4-5 serious
I come through, 4-5, serious
Slay got me Shade 45 Sirius
Gold frame shades 45, Siri

I used to be up in a tunnel like a hundred deep
Screamin', ""Nine Trey, Su-Woo"" with a bunch of Bs
Never tied up shoes, but every night we would run the streets
Nigga, fuck growlin', it was nights I heard my stomach speak
Then I started pumpin' that bass like they done a beat
Never let shit slide 'cause they might think somethin' sweet
Nigga, it's July, shots get hot like summer heat
When I pop up, niggas turn vegan, they never wanted beef

I know these streets with my eyes closed, so my worst fear is to die slow
Lie low, 'cause in '05 you flipped to five-o
And I know, 'cause if Alpo did it to Rich
For some bricks, word to Flex, he had no reason to lie, po'
Aight though, we ain't gotta dwell on the past
Devilish laugh, arrow spins I'm ahead of the crash
Better to clash, when you handle your beef, settle it fast
Metal and mask but still keep an elegant class

Who the greatest all time? Where them niggas reside?
I seen all fifty names, man them niggas done lied
I take the first forty-eight, make them niggas retire
Last two we could joust, make them niggas my squad
Fuck them, let's see how the ladies fare
Swerve on these bitches like I'm settin' my baby hair
They feel a type way, but they never gon' take it there
They tryna keep it cute 'cause they know that it's safer there
They wouldn't dare

I can't explain what I dealt with
Know it was all weak and creep and stealth shit
When I come from under the belt with a metal shit
Forever Brownsville, numb, I never felt shit (You're as cold as ice)
I still got that real world charm, nigga, be alarmed
Body armor on, warmer in my palm (NYC)
Where you get the storm before the calm
(M.O.P.) OG and we treat it like Vietnam

My generation drank forty ounces of Old English to ease the pain
Y'all niggas drink White Claws, nigga, we ain't the same (kahm-kahm)
It's curfew whenever I come through (kahm-kahm)
Kill the fuckery, them niggas can't fuck with me (come on!)
I'm really 'bout it in the war
Taxiderm' your bitch head, mount it on the wall (it's M.O.)
Throw it up, nigga, we stand tall (it's M.O.)
You know what the fuck we stand for, it's M.O

Too many niggas in here, but never follow the script
It's movie time, release the clip and have 'em doin' a flip
Off-white Virgil, need a whip with the interior Crip
On any given goal to slide, nigga, minus the slip
Checkin' niggas outta line, like it ain't nothin' to skip
Step in my section trying to flex and end up gettin' you stripped
Too many niggas watered down, might go to sinking they ship
And if it's beef, I come to trip, I never pull up and dip
It's Precious season, nigga

Walkin' in the storm, my face had the hatred in it
Mons had the colorful money with the staples in it
Grew up street and I stay committed (Yeah)
Movin' white back and forth over green like table tennis
Guap was pourin' in, my Glock was roarin'
At nineteen, shots hit you like hydroxychloroquine
I'm still forty with the forty close
In the 840 playin' new E-40 with some horny hoes

(Yeah) Finally, y'all been waiting
To hear a verse for the economy stimulation
With Bible verses forsaken and tribal authorization
We marchin' as we awaken the mobsters across the nation
Ask doubles next to ride
The show gun with Shogun to testify
Fasho son, we hold somethin' that electrifies
N-1 L-B, no one left behind, pause it

Where I grew up in the world of Pop to give you the shot
When I vodka, the glocka Blocka! and blew the dot
You want attention? I'll give you the spot
And run up on your favorite artist aimin' at him, like, ""Do the drop""
I smack the cobble out a gobblin' blogger
Togglin' robbers with my saliva as hot as a pot of lava
And guapa, my mob has been on the sly since Yo Gabba Gabba
Trying to get the drop guava, interior baklava

Straight out the Bronx, straight off the fall
Straight off the motherfucking claw for who's settin' it off
Blocks where they spark a lot, click with the Glock a lot
Catch you at the parking lot, park you in your parking spot
Niggas know it's sex money, flex money, they do a lot
What's better than more letters and buddha spots?
Buck fifties for niggas that don't do a lot
Go ahead and get your shooter, get your shooter shot

Shaq Dies', front if you want
Flow through the spirit of Kobe, I don't puff on no blunts
My estate got a shuttle, you punks
Funny thing I got places in my place I ain't discover in months (Months)
I naturally hover above 'em, I'm Kal-El
Touchdown in the arena, the crowd yell
And if they want beef, I'm ringing the cowbell
This crispy cream make 'em ring like they found Mel

Jones, and I don't need no introduction
I'm the best, pound for pound, it's no discussion
Seen some mass destruction, this how I leave niggas area
Me, Shaq and Gunz, nothin' scarier
A nightmare on Elm Street when I hit the booth
A motivational speaker when I spit the truth
Come down to Pensacola if you need some proof
I could mess your smile up like a missin' tooth
Ahead of my time, but still in a league of my own
I tried to quit, but they just won't leave me alone
If you ain't got the right price, stop callin' my phone
M-mister, y'all must've forgot the king of the throne

Aw man! Ayo Kay!
Ayo what up Red Alert?
I don't think they ready for this
Well they better tool up cause I ain't done!

When you hear the shots
I'm not documenting, I'm 2Pac-umenting
I'm one of the Beatles, how I'm whippin' from that Lennon
Bye-bye, hater, real niggas winning
The 4th of July don't tell me I'm independent (Nah!)
I'm killing it, bro, my motive locomotive
Zero to ninety-nine like my Netflix loaded (Get em'!)
Telling your boss brick city boys is fire
Never mind, half of y'all be talking through the wire

Media slandered me, so that's why I'm slayin' you niggas
Never knew what hit him, got the doctor X-rayin' you niggas
Turned you to a victim, man, I sprinkle some yay' on you niggas
They thinkin' it's drug-related, gotta weigh on you niggas
All on the radio with the beef, got 'em sweatin' like they was Keith
And it's never gonna be peace, I'm shooting up your album release
Baggin' bricks with your niece, come and get you a piece
I'm taking responsibility for the murder increase, it's Buck

Kay wanted me to be one of the buck because I been a buck
Back when a pack of Newports was a buck, I was a young buck
On the corner of Monarch, kids from Far Rock hoppin' over the turnstile
To set up shop up top by the Jamaican spot
My joints have been a bop, from vinyl, cassettes, CDs and streams
On every Martin Luther Boulevard, they payin' homage to the shooter from Queens
Right now you wanna be this cracker from Queens
Fact though, I'm covered from special fleece to my Wallaby Supremes

This one image is unblemished without one gimmick
Your line of scrimmage, I cross it in one sentence
The core writer for those that lost sight
Of the promenade, now heed the words of the poor righteous
That build with mathematics for those whose path is empty
But y'all know math was in me for the past half a century
Now do the knowledge how the real writers do it
Cause I want the smoke, charcoal, and lighter fluid

Talk shit, but I could back up game
The way you silly motherfuckers on the mic talk the same old same
How you wouldn't hesitate to kill, buck, rack, attack
Ask him if he said to Shan, he said, ""FUCK THAT!""
Bullshit, I'm not the one to get with
Pressure gets so violent, givin' a fuck what I hit
I play your songs like a lullaby that put me to sleep
And I sing it like a pussy that's this deep

KRS is big and scary
I'm that legend, getting cream, legendary
Hear me, I rocked this, shocked this, hip-hop this
I woke and I wake up, these rappers are not this
The hotness, I would knock some of these rappers out
But you can hear they already unconscious
I got this, on the top list, fake, I'm not this
Temple of Hip-Hop, rising to the top, kid

Every verse is a persecution, it's murder music
You get cursed, the room is like army, they get the hearses movin'
Fire shit, you get burned and ruined, it's burnin' fuses
Bunch of designer, heard a human loses, deserve these bruises (Go)
Nobody tellin' me that it could ever be somebody better
I got a vendetta, I mean every word, every letter
Ahead of my time and you know not to ever put me in position
Designed to put these rappers out of commission
All I spit is dope and after this, y'all gon' need intervention
Taking it back to that driving ambition

Look up to Twista how I be killing 'em like I'm in Wimbledon
I make a sweep when I'm doing the murdering
I put the cinnamon up in the pendulum
Minimum damage I would never do, I dead 'em like a barbiturates
Omnivorous with the flow, it don't matter which bar I bit you with
I could reorganize the confusion of a child Pharaoh
Now munch on that food for thought from a piss poor pimp from the ghetto
Hmm, I am approaching so I hope you're using a radar
Causing beautiful chaos in this unusual séance

Itchy trigger finger, watch me finger fuck it, niggas bust and
Squeeze the biscuit, hit him in his English muffin, repercussion
Call the homies, niggas spray the corner, now they fallin'
On the white sheet and bars, drag rappers by they wife beater
Drama King told me ""Drag, go stupid,"" so Imma go stupid
Made this fitted cap a drop top, almost mini couped it
Stick shift, automatic, automatic big clip, round clip
Hit a nigga while I downshift, yeah

It's me again, all I be is when, never if
If you see a lens, it's probably CNN or a gif
I could rat-a-tatter, your brain matter get scattered
And served up on a platter, they call it data, baiting cappers
I'm more like Beta Kappa, I'm great like your great great grandma
And they wanna protect with this Great Lake grammar
It's Rivers, that's why I gotta be called, decide if you fall
Or have to wear a thought or break a side of the law
And fight for yours

We a hundred deep, don't give a fuck 'bout your capacity
They tell me who they favorite, I ain't hatin' but they trash to me
Y'all know this my world so I'ma hold it down like gravity
I'm bitin', that's a casualty, I'm blowin' out your cavities
Keep a pocket rocket for the people pocket watchin'
Pull up with a Glock and cock it, got you beggin' not to pop it
Y'all gotta stop, I want more cash and more fast
I went on a run like I'm all gas from all bad

You're dealing with a locksmith, my mindset is too meticulous
Rhymes melt when I sing like the wings from Kid Icarus
Every rap is indicative, diction is like a diction
I'm ditching that status quo to inhabit flows that I stitched in
You're pitching garbage, each comment is like a gauntlet
A conscious effort to execute rappers that try to test it
Ingest them and exit through my excrement through my intestine
Intestinal fortitude afforded you is what you left with

I don't smoke but stay with a cig like Mary-Kate Olsen
'Cause my patience short as D Brees or DeRozan
I ain't a Fashion Nova model that swallow rappers for follows
Just for mentions on blogs with flaws like it Apollo
But keep the toolie, pockets blue like Tookie, patience short as Uzi
You a groupie, you a rat like Mickey, you look like a goofy
Out your kufi, yeah you out your top, thinkin' you gon' move me
You like Sookie, you suck dick for chips, I'm too rich and choosy, bitch

I ain't gotta tell you what I've done, who I am or where I'm from
If you don't know it by now then you just dumb
I ain't got no pistols, inf beams, choppers or no Dracos
No car, no girlie, beams or no bankrolls
I buy shares, land, LLCs and payrolls
Kuwaiti and Bahraini dinar, gold bouillon
Mutual funds, nigga, fuck a dollar and a peso
I got seven investors that'll invest when I say so

Hey yo, max eight lines, I wrote this spinning a yarn though
Foul mind, the villainous Queens, Lance Feurtado
Mean face Murcielago, over god flows
Salute that, shit on schedule like it's Jumu'ah
I don't do the work, I just stuff bags to pass shooters
Let the foreign skirt, squeeze semi and let it squirt
All the facts, all the chow now, getting rich off of merch
Laser beams, I done turn niggas' Foamposites to red bottoms

Yeah I'm underrated and I never sold my soul
And I never switched slang to sound southern when the game changed
Niggas say they real, til you see 'em on the real
Then you find out they a bitch ass nigga, just with a record deal
For real, the internet gon' get these niggas killed
Hide behind that keyboard cuz, gon' make some blood spill
Your insecurity gon' make this .45 open up your mind and bring enlightenment
And then you'll have more clarity

If I roll a hundred deep, it's two hundred fists, two hundred feet
At least a hundred guns so every nigga get one apiece
Bitch, I'll piss on the tombstone you underneath
This sick, don't play this shit if your stomach weak
I can stomach beef, I done faced danger
I squeeze like a waist trainer then you will lose stomach meat
I run the streets, so when Cass scheme, that mean
They gotta get shot like a mandatory vaccine

Out of sight, out of mind, til I creep up behind
Double barrel shots you out, everything on your mind
Figure that, like the next line you tryna consider
But you careful so you dumb down, you ain't no spitter
Then you post, you got beef, tell me you ain't no hitter
You a tweeter, who mouth flame more than his heater
From the days of the park jams, blowin' the tweeters
Rugged raps with a DJ cut in the meetings

G-G-Get 'em!
Let me give you facts, before CashApp
I was frontin' niggas workin', they was bringing cash back
Before Instagram was selling up instant grams
Connect 'em and I can never fuck with no middle man
Before the fake jewelry and niggas with all the cappin'
40 karats in my Philly, this nigga was all platinum
Huh? You little niggas in the way
This million dollar payday's me and my nigga Kay Slay

It's the West Coastin', New Yorkin', low-ridin', Crip-walkin' nigga
Anyone can get it, masked like the pandemic
Niggas mad I don't pick up, I got multiple phones
Slay took a month to find me, got multiple homes
Pop off, my black talons will bullet your vest
(Gun noises) 300 blackout, fully suppressed
Cut through your cold crew like a saw blade
Then up at Mr. Chow's eatin' saute

Jersey Journal, where the next signal infernal
And eat chicken with friction before I try 'em, kidnap the colonel
Trigger title, trigger finger, trigger treacherous
Double shots of extortion, exercise to an exorcist
Exercise my freedom, beat 'em when I leave 'em, eat 'em
Even when the odds ain't even, I get even
With Kay Slay, fuck they play, the rebirth and replay
Mr. Slap-Your-Favorite-DJ, this all has changed on eBay
It's Jers'!

Top billing how we Gizmo and Milk shit
Grimy crimies, did all the dirt and the filth with
Yeah, my young buck days was on the real strip
Fillmore Slim shit, straight off a film strip
I ran through more fine women than Wilt did
Superstars, chem fills bitches with some soft and silk lips
Made a killing off of dealing that real fix
Numbers like a pinball wizard, tilly-tilt shit

I'm the product of Frank White
Whoever acting tough gets stage frights
Getting clearer visions of grave sights
So get my cake right, something in the bake and it ain't light
Or something in your face and it ain't life
So don't play with me, Hell gates await
When I come to the 8th, I shoot it faithfully
And tell Mitch to pray for me
Slay with the AK nigga, that's my speciality
Brooklyn forever, M.A.F.I.A 'til the death of me

Look, for my next verse I done left Earth
The internet done triple my net worth off a sweatshirt
Expert, I let the TECs work, your neck chirp
Been a devil, bench press metal, I'm doin' chest work
One of the deepest, see you've been warned
Please believe you're now lookin' at Jesus in human form
I'm Jet Li, respect me like you speakin' to Scooter Braun
The newest legend in the league, I lead with my shootin' arm
It's Payne

All you assholes finished, I don't have those limits
You'll get this work in all black, it's a black-owned business
But you cats don't get it, that's why I'm stunting on you newbies
Your father was a super fan, your mother was a groupie
That's why I trip like, ""Who you tryna rap with?""
Sounding nothing like yourself, who you tryna catfish?
Like you bodied that shit, shut your lying ass lips
Do I look like I been playing nigga? Colin Kaepernick, motherfucker

You got the memo, murder game is my M.O. (Fact though)
Lurk the frontline, not from out of the window (No!)
Take a life, then take your jewels for a memento
You make it to the outro, you got to pay for the intro
Like a nympho, ain't fuckin' around, I ain't (I'm not)
Shoota a sure shot, like a D in the paint
Don't need a long stick, just a .38, I'm straight
One dome shot, that's how I show restraint (Shoota!)

They like damn we ain't heard from you in a minute
Shit get great from my present see bitch I'm gifted
They said it's only right they callin' me cold see I'm the sickest
I heard it just like Curse of the Lottery you hoes is scripted
Don't get it twisted me and you was a difference
I'm a superstar you role playin' bitches is pimpin'
Oh and did I mention, keep me up out your mentions
You bitches ain't soldiers y'all just be wantin' attention

Hey yo New York, get the money, five boroughs of death
My dude was called, where's the money, fire, birds and meth (Hey!)
Hood Bunny, Bugs Bunny, Iceberg, and Sweats
First baguettes, Big Stepper learn the steps
Earn respect with connects 'cause my word was kept (Yes!)
Swerve the 'Vette like Sean Paul for more medicine
Fur gon' slip, like I don't spit, burn the blessed
The truth, 2Pac jewels like I serve them wet
Vado!

This homicide was prophesized before I was a toddler's size
Any job nigga, I am overqualified
I'm the kind of nigga whose cloth it be hard to find
Integrity? I put mine over dollar signs
A nigga play me, then he out his mind
As long as my niggas is winnin', I ain't gotta shine
If you can't see I'm a G, then you kinda blind
Die 'fore you disrespect me, nigga, bottom line

Return of the barbaric barbarian bar spitter
Bar 9 bar guns ballin' like bar mitzvah
You bar 9 your bars done I'm Barific
My bars gifted real rapper my bars Christmas
Cooked like a bar & grill I spit these bars in your grill
Homer bluehead keep a mag I'm Bart Simpson
My bars mention muscle bars I'm bar benchin'
Ted Danson have a beer and cheer these bars pimpin'

I see these niggas flex as if I ain't one of the best at this
And wonder why I'm attacking the mic like a pessimist
My name should be next to excellence, bless the globe
With the pestilence, like methodin', and put in work like a Mexican
A record for killin' tracks, somethin' like John Gotti
What he have, like 19? I just caught 99 bodies
Slay, I'm sorry, I know this hip-hop camaraderie
But since nobody bodied me, don't accept my apology

Stop chasing props niggas, top niggas march
By the cops, followed hot blocks, they pop niggas
I ain't one of you niggas, I'm a pair of Gators
You a pair of Uggs, you ugly but you comfortable nigga
I'm the OG, pre-Cardi nigga, the diamond in the back
Cadillac black, Pretty Ricky, Maserati nigga
The god-body, rock a party nigga
That can socially distance your head from your motherfuckin body nigga

I'm so Bronx, nigga, my middle name is Jonas
BX microphonist, also known as
The Bronx bomber, comma, hip-hop's Barack Obama
Osama, Dalai Lama, either way gon' be some drama
I'm the one even your momma fall for
I'm droppin' the bat and take it first nigga ball four
I'm roundin' the bases while niggas trip over they shoelaces
With they screwfaces, mic broke in two places

100 deep, know how we roll
Find where a nigga sleep, blowing out peepholes
Nothing never been sweet but we icy cold
Put a price on niggas' head for that shit you said
Got back so we boomerang, watch what you say
Hot shit'll spray, in a box you will lay
Know the Mobb be the gang with the Drama King
Always gonna hold it down, that's what I promised P

I did it, y'all forgot, I'm still with the scripture
Every bar has a plot and these lines are configurate
The mind over mine over mind over the pendant
I am signing on the plot I will put 'em in the blender
A dope spitter with a pro black agenda
Supported by the black referendum
And this only a sliver of the splendor
Homie it's the sensei
A dope boy with a flow no lo contendere

They told me pussy and paper go together like problems and pistols
I'm a problem to pussies who want to play with my issue
I'm pullin' rappers close, that shit you wrote was half-ass
I'm way past first class, laugh when your hearse pass
I Kill 'em with kindness, King EDI the highest
Me, Noble, Slay, you can see we the flyest
We load the spray, pussy niggas retire
100 deep, now you can watch us rise up

When 'Rock the Bells' dropped, I was locked into hip hop
Fresh off the porch with my brother Sean's boom box
Around the same time when I heard Illmatic
I was on my block, sellin' long dimes to the addicts, yeah
I remember back when Rae dropped the purple tape
We was young Outlawz, tryna raise the murder rate
Me against the world when I first heard Doggystyle
Still screamin' ""Fuck the world, doggystyle""

No more mumble rap, back to that boom bap
No cap, I'm in the trap where the goons at
Peace to all my niggas up top, getting them lunes back
Salute to the brother of me and my nigga Loon back
Harlem World's finest, let's be honest
You don't gotta give me dap, nigga, just pay homage
Peep my steps, always keep the piece on deck
I'm from the danger zone where we handle beef by death, nigga

Everybody's an opp, plenty bodies'll drop
Slay hit me up, told me body the block
Go ape the whole eight, no way they hold weight
They so fake, okay? I won't play, ya don't say?
Kay shit, basic when they spit
Face it, we not only the zone, we the matrix
Your algorithm rhythm off balance
I'm 'bout to start the ""We don't care if you die"" challange

Live from the Wire but I reside in the A
You admire the attire, I am sighin' today
No Jaden but I'm Lord Raiden
Show you with all the cadence
Lightning in my tips, with these scripts, I'm full paid in
And what a great game in heaven, boosted my cranium
Bars became za induced with titanium
Stars beyond Mars, the truth, I'm so empty
With six spliffs in the booth, it hits like Vibranium

Ayo Kay Slay, we can't let the BS slide
The game ain't been the same since DS died
Got five niggas jumping out the GS5
Will leave my gun smoking like a PS5
DS5 the street rap, somebody tell me where the streets at
This that shit to make the heat clap
From my niggas selling cheap packs
Them niggas keep straps, the Onyx is the kings of that street rap

It is Sticky, don't make me put my hands on you
Nigga, I could tell you what each one of my fingers do
My pinky finger, that's with the pink ring at
And my ring finger, never put a ring on that
And my middle finger? That's how I feel about that
I use my index finger to make that thing clap
And my thumb, I ain't got a use for that
So I put it in a bitch ass while I fuck her from the back

What you lames claim is relevant ain't
The culture's five elements, felons pistol whip your pelican vapes
I shoulda named the metal Baretta the Drake
Givin' em back to back hits 'til your skeleton breaks
Yo take a new era super head in my Wraith
Givin' me fitted call it the 7 and 1-8
Each one of my bars smoke ya whole 16
How you trap in your mom's necklace and wear big jeans?

I ace the motherfuckin' track like a pro's supposed to
I'm blowin' up in this bitch, you know, Apollonia
And anytime I did a rhyme, I did it for the culture
The doctor said I need a culture, I might have the 'rona
I beat the shit and now I'm like a hundred times stronger
Run for the block and flippin' rocks to a stock holder
Hold my composure, bring my hand up when the shots over
A hundred deep with the soldiers, and we shoulder to shoulder

Yo, I live a DJ's dream, hearin' fans scream
Cash in my hand green, they wanted to ban me
'Cause most of it was tax free, at last, me and Slay connect
Niggas know the outcome
We got mixtapes with features better than your album
Bounce Master with the Street Sweeper
For you heat seekers and them double D cup ladies and IG divas
My mixtape gave your boyfriend power
Holla at me when y'all got my flowers (Bounce)

I'm Junior Reid, I run these streets
Killin' all these hip-hop beat
Hey, I just can't be defeat
One blood family, we came here to eat
Murder!
When I roll, you know I roll deep
My hand stay strong and you know we don't cheat
Trap for the money and you know we don't sleep

If it's beef and we don't make up after talkin'
It's a high chance you gon' be wearing makeup in the coffin
I think of Busta Rhymes the way that the cops flamin' us
Like ""put your hands where I can see before it get dangerous""
Fuck twelve and whoever gave 'em information
State property parties, you want a invitation?
You don't wanna do that, family
Them people gon' have to move your family, it ain't a movie y'all

You woke up a sleeping giant, there's no one breathing this fire
It's me, I'm known globally mostly for being violent
I'm closing up both of your eyelids cause no one seeing me rhyming
Fuck quarantine, I'm outside, I'm a morbid beast on the mic
These are more than schemes that I'm writing
It's for the fiends and the piper
New cocoa leaf, it ain't Pyrex, hoping that they don't die next
Shoutout to street sweeper, I breathe ether, my team G'd up
The streets need us like cheap heaters and clean sneakers

Wais P, you should have gave me the whole song (Why?)
'Cause I'm doper than the shit Demi Lovato overdosed on
Put a ho on every corner you post on, poison potion
Give you my life on every track that I spoke on
Blow bullets 'til the barrel is hot enough to cook coke on
Phasers photon, never on stun, give you the whole drum
Wanna know why I'm on the second run? I go dumb
Plus a hundred rounds beats fifty in any gun

I can spot the lies in they lines, what lines in they eyes
Is fear, you hear? A coward cries when he dies
I was down now I'm up, they surprised by my rise
I've been out, fresh fade, bitches thought that I was Nas
Lord please forgive me, I'm a sinner
Sweat suits, gold ropes swinging like a 80s dope dealer
Trust me, I get iller, underneath the chinchilla
The street sweeper, Kay Slay with a hundred killers

Always been disrespectful, never been polite
Slay got me on the record with a bunch of niggas I don't like (I really don't though)
Them niggas corny, and their verses is not hard
Probably like ten rappers on this record that I got robbed
I'm the truth, I'm just realizing my worth
Niggas gon' turn this shit off after they hear my verse (I don't blame 'em)
And fuck whoever feel disrespected
Niggas gon' be mad Kay Slay put me on this record (Ah)

The best ever, bulletproof, the vest leather
Head shot, talkin' big bags of cheddar
Harlem, we run shit, you fags sleep
Cemetery, last stop, your bag's deep
Six feet, gun and a mask, my team creep
Mausoleum, you can see 'em, your team's sleep
Harlem, mob style, we run shit
Sheet rock, bury niggas for dumb shit

Grenades, bombs and rocket launchers
The smell of dead bodies, the odor comes back to haunt ya
Gucci vests from Dapper Dan, mountains of blow on a glass table
Look like a goddamn avalanche
Construction bags of snow, one scale
One doctor just in case your blood pressure fail
We got diesel, weed, coke and lean by the pail
Two phones next to that old bitch out in Wales

Show a sign, force on the course, it's authentic
You cross the sauce, try to be boss, get lost in it
That's a early retirement, call it a forced finish
Fuck a Porsche with horse, I put your horse with Porsche in it
Nigga Mike Cee, syllable, syllabicate
Syllabicate, it's so real, realize, realization
Realization, realize, real
S-Syllabicate, s-syllabicate, syllables, Mike Cee

I swear to God if I die tonight, I'm taking a few niggas with me
My little man just came home doing 5 so I gave him 50
I ain't gave his Dior back meaning I got this Llama with me
Run Scott my papers 50 sellin' bricks I don't fuck with dizzies
Keep a lot of shooters outside it's gon be hard to clip me
Before I surrender to God and Mississippi
Got these bitches being my mule to get some bigger titties
Falling cost me 260 got another 60 with me

Fuck y'all, thought I better talk, caught up a narrative
I sat back watching you tryna figure what bag it is
Imagine if I came back, Super Lover with savages
And put a tilting was building change the average of marriages
Cause she's still after me due to audio in audacity
For cardio and the tune grooving room at capacity
When parties over, we boom boom, for you it's gravity
A tragedy, by two masterpieces causing catastrophe

You could have a hundred verses from my hundred persons
But this one emerges
And it's curtains when you get to squirting on a piece of Birkin
Detroit is a mindset, as soon as the verse ends, you rewind it
Knowing that the Drama King was behind it
I'm Page Kennedy don't let the last man escape
Get your ass kicked by a movie star that looks more like an asterisk
Get your bifocal lens
You a fighter that wouldn't even punch vocals in

I spit stupid, you just stupid
Don't even walk off your porch, you should just stoop it
You too bitch for this goon shit, it ain't just music
We shoot you and jam to your death, no Rick Rubin
Yo my gun blow drumroll, til it unload
Or til the gun broke, then punch holes through a chump's soul
I'm muggin', it's just jokes, I'm friendly and shit
Get higher it's the highway to heaven, I'll send you a lift

(Gunplay) 7.62s, nigga never left clues
Crib looking like a motherfuckin evidence room
And I keep a street sweeper, nothing less than this broom
And that's only when I'm in a fuckin excellent mood
I got four nine-pieces on a four-door panel
Louis open-toed sandals, overdose on those samples
Living legend in the 'jects, nigga daddy every threat
Homie died in his holster, got the weapon, never left

The pandemic got niggas searching for endemic
You either win or you a dub, fuck the club, don't get it fucked up
It's still paid for the bin
And you just gotta find a fucking way in
Now we gonna see who's a boss
And rise above the COVID or take a fucking loss
Wear the mask or don't, I don't give a fuck
I'ma still get a buck and a gold medal, I will never settle

I be the block (Dynamite) so hit the sheets to the streets
Like playing games with Jamar's will beat your feet
I'ma drop a straight 8 for my nigga Kay's beat
We go back like Fat Jack my nigga Harlem heat
Got bodies for a throttle smashing King Midas
Put the drip in the game drop jewels and pop bottles
I'm valedictorian ask any historian
I'm back from streets you pullin' up in that Delorean

I'ma keep the knowledge, yeah, two cyphers
(Keep it a hundred) Lord J and Kay Slay, that's two triflers
We roll deep when we hold heat
Stay away or get sprayed with a new virus
They manufactured a new crisis
With plans to capture your third iris
I stand with the stature of the bird ibis
I'm like Dawoodi when I'm doing my duty (facts)

I'm from where Big and Hov came Pop Smoke cocaine
Rope slayin' over coats and them dope rope chains
Bed-Stuy Veteran fella been ridin'
Better than I've ever been America's bidin'
Harris no comparison since
So don't let that fly shit go to your head like Mike Pence
I got seniority Francis Sorority
Sonja Blade bitch just respect my athority

Lets take it back to the essence where it all began (Yeah)
Hip-hop, the original man (C'mon)
First emcee ain't my claim to fame
'Cause I been getting money, ain't a damn thing changed
I'm Coke La Rock and I'm still on the scene (Let's go)
The true OG to the culture you're in (Okay)
Bronx legend, respect the crown
And pay homage where it started, we call it the Boogie Down

I'm from the era catching cabs on Broadway
Put 'em on hold, ride around town all day
Way before the Uber and a Lyft it was OJ
Do the kickstep, man, just like Kid Play
We're on the east side like DJ Kay Slay
Smoke your chronic up, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre
Sprinkle my man, E-40, he from the bay
Yo I say butter man and you say Parkay

Smooth B kick shit Pelé like soccer
You that man in the middle, cockblocker
I been a G, never been a sucker
I don't hide, never scared, not a ducker
Above the Rim like I'm in Harlem at the Rucker
Motherfucker, I'm thorough with this
I ring bells around the world every borough with this

Always had the bands like Coi Leray
So I'm young enough to relate to the YouTubers
Old enough to still date a few cougars
Yet the struggle became a weapon for me
So success became a separate story
But them cheques, got 'em checkered for me
Shit, I'm shooting from Steph' territory
And I get more love than Diddy's license
We rollin' a hundred deep, and I'm the city's nicest

Look, I'm Tommy Egan in the Honda weaving
Leave your Mama grieving for the non-believing
On the deacon, Dominican mommy ganja steaming
Bomb with demons that'll take your chain and go to pond to peacing
I quit trapping cause my music is dope
You might've saw me in the lane but I'm truly the goat
You try to tell him calm down, bro was doing the most
They left him in the hospital with a tube in his throat

I trap with the guys knowing I'ma capitalize
But slaps I'ma drive to DC those capital rides
Put rappin' aside I got yak and captions to buy
She smashin' up lines so big they look like capital I's
We back in the times so start us here you back in the pines
Snap but I'm fine the Henny and the gas intertwine
I smash and I grind got the work stashed with the 9
I'm where they'll put you on a shirt like a fasion design

Yo!
You from the hood Uptown Queens New York
Save the milk cereal with the fork
Scraped the plate and now get the fuck out my way
We on the grind yes I got a lot on my mind
Back in the days I used to wanna punch them in face
I changed my ways and now I just wanna get paid
Smoking haze out a trombone Nicholas Cage
Fire tire is burning times is turning

Kaflow Kaboom rolling a hundred deep
Ever since a young wolf, I always hunted sheep
I already killed all the wolves that wanted beef
Seen a nigga brains on the floor and it made ya stomach weak
I'm from the streets where they brag about puttin' you underneath
A lot of niggas gon' get shot before the summer reach
Take you to the balcony, hang you from your feet
My office hours are from nine to five, not from one to three

A living legend like Slay on The Box
The big dime baby I'm like Jay to the opps
Purple Coogi Purple Tape I'm like Rae to the opps
When it time it ain't the mink then i'm playin' the fox
I'm sorry king of these Pradas and not Adidas
NDF We the mob and I'm the leader free the opps
Fear the law, get money, and flee the cops
Fuck the judge fuck the feds cause they the opps

Sickening, street smart but the flow ignorant
Henchmen, but never wear no Jimmy when I'm hittin' it
Big up to the game, bookstores, no more memberships
Shout out to the cub and Dior, free the innocent
Outlaw, live by often, I would die for
I get all the blame, someone get shot, they say it's my fault
So when they talk, I just pay 'em never mind
Cause when I spot em, I'ma dot em like the letter I

I'm Toussaint Louverture, unfamiliar? Google more
Gurkha out the humidor, wise man who fool 'em all
Prove 'em wrong, told Kay Slay I would do the song
Move along if you ain't about that communion, dawg
Through the fog and darkness, the world be in peril
'Til we expel the devils and renew the godly process
I'm blessed, not pressed but I'm vexed, the game culture
Brothers obeyin' other suckers who ain't of us
We reppin' that red, black and green, that's a thing
Like Pythagorean themes that put data in the machines
The latter means I saw a lot, Earth a tourist spot
Still we universal beings, this rehearsal VN
P.S., we turn T-shirts to tuxedos
With flowers from the mall with no GMOs or cheat codes
The power is in lovin' the death of your own ego
O.E. go, that's that Brooklyn

Who really the best rapper since Pun ain't here?
Y'all know the answer to that when Bamz in here
The most underrated, the most hated, the most doing the most
The most almost famous, the most favorite
Bodega getting them chips again, what happened?
First class back from Switzerland, no capping
I'm the voice they wanna silence, who said it's late?
It's perfect timing
Load up the Uzi, headshot, take the diamond

In the car with 2 blicks them shits got 3 attempts on it
You gon be the first full body
Toe tag zip em up the doc won't stitch em up
Sucka ass niggas been lollipops
Spin the block twice won't leave til a body drop
My influence in the hood is impeccable
Stir fry something turn a nigga to a vegetable
*gunshot sounds*
Hello!

It's P dot T dot K nigga
I'm back looking for drama I'm here to slay niggas
NYC tryna be A niggas
Blatant only way you figured out to get paid nigga
And let them niggas have they own style
And act like you niggas really from home
You know that where they shit was grown
And leave that drill shit alone too
Before the shot gets to drilling you
Nigga!

These rappers hoein' now, doin' anything to get papes
Even my DMs like a bitch to do a mixtape
I be killin' shit, I need a sponsorship from Ruger
Been ahead of my time, it's like I rhyme from the future
If niggas want trouble, homie, the trouble suit us
Ran up on you snakes, got me feeling like Medusa
They say they from the Bay, I'm nowhere specific
But those that don't know, nigga it's a difference

It's getting real hard to eat, no time to argue
Blow a driveway through your chest, let it park you
The broads done rip apart you
Sunset dark you, leave you hard to recharge, it'll restart you
No cinema like our own theatre scarier
Big Dubez, King Kirk, Brando, three of the thieves
Period, lyricists, storytellin'
Cordelen, split your fuckin' watermelon

4D! I go up top they take enough shots (enough shot)
Now I'm home, we see what's up then (home now)
Let you tell it, you Teddy Bruckshot
All I'm hearing is Teddy Ruxpin
Trust and believe, sleep on the D's
Get tough then, mics, I crush them
Causin' disruption, we talkin' a tusslin'
Figure four rap, nigga, fuck all the fussin'
End of discussion

I been livin' on the road for the past week (For real)
Makin' more moves than an athlete (Uh huh)
I'm from the backstreets where they pack heat
I deliver, got more drop offs than a taxi
Hated by the ones who love, shit's weird
I been seein' six figures for like six years
Young boy goin' dumb and he 'bout to go dumber
Two sticks on him, he think he a drummer

A fist up for black people, our lives matter
Like your life, but my life, they won't understand it
Traumatic stress on my hands, this is from being captured
Mutilated like castration, part of them chapters
But this a never ending story, them pages continue
My shade part of that food chain minus the menu
It's deeply rooted in genetics, the past that we've been through
Original Hebrew, got me feelin' it sacrificial

I got the power I'm putting in, punching the clock like the '99
'89 before that seventy-five
When I was around and I first rhymed
While many searched hard for punchlines
I had some that you cannot find
Had some that you can't rehearse
All I had to do was voice a verse, the Kay Slay show

Fuck chill, I think it's time that people really know
What's real, nobody else get to spin it
I know these haters won't condone, everything I own
Pointed at the throne, and I don't care who's sittin' in it
Bank on that, nobody son trust
After the clashes and the ashes come dust
You came for the fame, you gotta do what one must
But me, I'm only here to eradicate the unjust
Real talk, motherfuckers the worst
They ain't grow into fuck niggas, they were suckers from birth
Rub shoulders and then it's over, you touch 'em you cursed
I can't wait to put love in reverse
The verse woulda been iller if it wasn't for Slay
He said ""'Sau it's for the culture, not today""
I said ""Cool, and usually you're always right
But just remember culture vultures ain't always white""

DJ Kay Slay, the drama king
Rolling 110 deep
That's right!
It had to be done!
Everything revolves 360°
What comes around goes around
Bring it back to the talent over popularity
Start talkin' to the people
Instead of about the people
Don't test me
You fuck around next time
I do rolling 200 deep on you motherfuckers!"

Hope you remember

I was once someone's best man
Used to call him a true friend
In fact I even introduced him to his wife
Go ahead and try to blow
Reach as far as your lungs can go
Often puff, blow the whole thing down...
It's a miracle I'm still around
'Cause I don't wanna be around
When they ask you
What made me do it
I hope you tell thеm
It was the backstab that I've been through
In what world
Do you savages livе
Where you thought I'd be cool?
And I put a bullet through my heart

I was once somebody's fool
Hear that somebody's still you
Haven't given up on making you my wife
Go ahead and try to blow
Reach as far as your lungs can go
Often puff, blow the whole thing down...
It's a miracle I'm still around
'Cause all I wanna do is die

There’s something I missed
Was it something I didn’t say
Or was it something I did
When I look into my precious mirror
Well it only shows my darkest features
I try to get a grip of the old me
But you take it away when you’re on the scene
And you make it all wrong
You make it all right
The minute you’re gone
The minute you’re back
X2
I know it’s been a while since we talked
That doesn’t erase feelings
And since my pride went for a walk
I don’t answer to nothing
And there’s a thousand roles I could have played
And there’s a thousand words I could have said
And there’s a thousand rules that I never knew
And there’s a thousand fools that could be you

And you make it all wrong
You make it all right
The minute you’re gone
The minute you’re back
X2
Do we stop here and reboot computers
Or do we linger still until it crashes later
I’ll shoot my brains out again if you come back around
But I won’t suffer the blame to watch us go down
You make it all wrong
You make it all right
The minute you’re gone
The minute you’re back
X2
You know it ain’t right but you will be back
We might as well rest ’til dawn
We’re making the best of it all
Tonight we’re immune
Say we’re bulletproof
And no matter how hard we bleed
Doesn’t mean that I want to leave"

'Til the loser always wins
Somehow with his beckoning
Bruising with his threads
Confusing what he says
But I won't live that way
Though I kind of want to anyway
Kind of want to play
With all the pretty and the pure
When I return to the earth
I return to the dust
No more beauty by the pound
In this I do not trust
'Cause nothing forgives
Rules and narrow margins
In our life
It's rules and narrow margins
But I'ma slip by
I can't find the time
I don't know the future
I couldn't bring that past back
I waste what little time I have

But I swear I almost touched it
Yet it slipped between my fingers
Sent shivers down my spine
Cut a splinter in my mind
But it wasn't nothing, again

But our life

So gonna slip by

This man of mine
Breaks to be desired
This man of mine
A man to be admired
This man of mine
He reconsigned his heart
This man of mine
Isn't yours, isn't mine
Isn't yours, isn't mine

A man of glass
Awaits his days
A man, a man
Without a cause
A gaze

Even to myself sure I don't belong
Doing what I feel, even if it's wrong
Head as hard as marble floor
Sure, we could get it on
How am I to change, should I change
I think we should join forces, but the journey is solo
I sip my whiskey simply wishing to go slow
Woah, now we're ones of the hearts and photos
The moment, I revisit it, I miss it more, more
A man of steel isn't real, it don't exist
Get the gist, my weakness is them eyeballs
My weakness is affection
If it's real, keep the real
If it's fake, get the next one
And send him, look down like I just said
You understand my progression, shit
Maybe in the next life, I'll learn my lesson, I'm guessin'

Some tales are meant to stay apart
Into a vague distance
Some lives are better kept apart
Bound to be inexistent
And some tales are meant to stay apart

There's traffic in the sky
And it doesn't seem to be getting much better
There's kids playing games on the pavement
Drawin' waves on the pavement, mm-mm
Shadows of the planes on the pavement, mm-mm

It's enough to make me cry
But that don't seem like it would make it feel better
Maybe it's a dream and if I scream it will burst at the seams
Whole place would fall into pieces
And then they'd say

Well how could we have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell, nah, nah, nah
If you keep addin' stones
Soon the water will be lost in the well, mm

And puzzle pieces in the ground
No one ever seems to be diggin'
Instead they're lookin' up towards the heavens
With their eyes on the heavens, mm-mm
The shadows on the way to the heavens, mm-mm

It's enough to make me cry
But that don't seem like it would make it feel better
The answers could be found, we could learn from diggin' down
But no one ever seems to be diggin'

But that don't seem like it would make it feel better

Was it hell or high water that broke our hearts?
Was it something I said, or just a cruel twist of fate?
Was it hell or high water and is it too late?
Oh, is it too late?

Man, all my life I've been searching for someone
To show me how it feels to be loved, and
How to love somebody back
And after stumbling through the years, I
Thought I found you just to
See you fading out into the night

Was it hell or high water that broke our hearts?
Was it something you said, or just a cruel twist of fate?
Was it hell or high water and is it too late?

See, all my life I've been silently reaching for
A hand to hold to warm the cold, spark a light
To guide me through alright
And after stumbling through the years
I thought I found you, just to
See you fading out into the night

Was it the trick of the light or a shot in the dark?
Was it hell or high water that broke our hearts?
Was it something we did, or just a cruel twist of fate?
Was it hell or high water and is it too late?

Hey, hey
Hey, hey

Was it a knife in my back or a fork in the road?
Was it hell or high water that left us alone?
Is it really game over? Is it really checkmate?

And I don't wanna go

Take another strife
Take another demon
Take another space
Take another dream and
Take another faith
Take another rise and
Take another fall

Well, you know what’s wrong with me
I keep on going on, I keep on chasing things
Type of things no good for me
They all tell me good for me
I try to not talk on it, it’s all that they talk about
You know what’s wrong with me
I blame that on word of mouth
Feed me, I’m hungry, I’m bleeding, take from me
I'm wounded, haunted, out here, they got me

Word of mouth, bring 'em out
Put 'em up, knock 'em down
Chew 'em up, spit 'em out

Something hides in every night
Brings desire from the deep
And with it comes a burning light
To keep us from our sleep

And as the full star tries his best to make the white pearl shine
Glances of a new day have arrived
And though he’s not alone, he fears to never love another
And leave his heart forever with her smile

Haa-aah

Habibi, light is burning
As I am burning
Habibi, light is burning
As I am yearning

Something died within a soul
Left the eyes to rust
And every time it is recalled
It covers all in dust

Haa-aah

Habibi, light is burning
As I am burning
Habibi, light is burning
As I am yearning

And meanwhile, a whole lot goes down
Somewhere in the darkness, us together for a while
You loved it then, so did I
A feeling deep inside you wants to love it all again
Now don’t leave it there, just give it a chance
If only I’d forget you after one last dance
But you’re everywhere, yes you are
In every melody and in every little scar
Yes you are, you are, love

Habibi, light is burning
As I am burning
Habibi, light is burning
And I am yearning"

The traveler’s son they come askin’
Where he came from
‘Cause they’ve watched him
Washing his face near the pond
A curious boy and they wonder
Where he came from
He says: “I, I have seen the world’s most beautiful places
Still I feel, as If I’m a walking machine
Watching it all through a screen
There is nothing in between to me
This might as well not be real”
Imagine, the girls take him up on a hill
It’s an Indigo night, there’s a chill
The boy is confused but he’s still
As they gather around him
So many of them, they all sing
About the pleasures of life
And he cries: ""Why can’t I sing along with some feeling, or some meaning?
It feels like I’ve always been blind
I don’t know why you girls are so kind
For there are so many in line
Whose lives aren’t as lost as mine”

Now something happened there
The smell of the grass, or maybe the air
There was no more despair
Just something about that night
Maybe the girls, they lit some light
And made everything right
‘Cause he’s never been
More alive"

Lying on the bathroom floor naked
Hiding coke inside all your orange Pixy Stix
You take a rail & spread it on your tit

But none of them matter to you except me
I've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to me except you

I heard it a long time ago

There's a small black notebook that you keep hidden underneath your bed
I've seen before
It says every dirty thing that you did with every single boy
You've ever been with

You've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to you except me

But none of them matter to me except you

And we fall asleep to the scent
Sleep to the scent of long stemmed roses
Always dreaming of sex
Dreaming of sex on the ceiling
And we sleep to the scent

She told him to take care of me, she headed down to Tennessee
Well, it's easier than just waitin' around to die

Then I came of age and I found a girl in a Tuscaloosa bar
She cleaned me out and she hit in on the sly
Well I tried to kill the pain, I bought some wine, I hopped a train
Well, it's easier than just waitin' around to die

Then a friend said he knew, where some easy money was
We robbed a man and brother, did we fly
But the posse caught up with me, and he drag me back to Muskogee
And now it's two long years, waitin' around to die

Now I'm out of prison and I got me a friend at last

Don't know one 'til it's gone
Searching for someone when they're right in front
Don't know one 'til it's gone
And every night I live a little

Sleep, baby, sleep
What are you waiting for?
The morning's on its way
You know it's only just a dream
Oh, sleep, baby, sleep
I'll lie next to you
The beauty of this mess is that it brings me close to you

I could be the one to give you all that I have
With a gentle touch and a foolish love
You could be the one to carry all my troubles away
With the words you say, all I need to hear

So sleep, baby, sleep
What are you waiting for?
The morning's on its way
You know it's only just a dream
Oh, sleep, baby, sleep
I'll lie next to you
The beauty of this mess is that it brings me close to you

Ignorance is torture but your love is right
Tip to tip a gentleman of the night
You feed my fascination with your skin like silk
And I'm still filled with wonder you could fool me easily

So sleep, baby, sleep
What are you waiting for?
The morning's on its way
You know it's only just a dream
Oh, sleep, baby, sleep
I'll lie next to you
The beauty of this mess is that it brings me close to you

So lay here and press up next to me
'Cause we'll be alright, we'll be alright
But when we leave I know it's hard
'Cause it's all we know, but we'll be alright
We'll be alright, right

Sleep, baby, sleep
What are you waiting for?
The morning's on its way
You know it's only just a dream
Oh, sleep, baby, sleep
I'll lie next to you
The beauty of this mess is that it brings me close to you"

When heaven is so out of reach

You love life more than me
It is never how it should be
I need, I need
You to tell me how to be
I'm painting the sky for you and me
So far, so far
I can taste it on your tongue
The words you've said in all the songs I've sung

Compare me to the sea
To rhyme  in poetry
I'm done fighting  you
Compare me to the sea

Too late, too late
To live any other way
When all I have to give is company
I know, I know
I don't mind being on my own
If I'm not free then what is left of me


To give you everything is not I want
When I'm living how always knew I would be
To give you everything is not what I want

Not long ago I heard a song
Reminded me of how we lost our senses
The days were short, the nights were long
Wrong was nice, we sabotaged our chances

We lost control so easily
We fell in love to disagree
Locked the door and threw away the key

'Cause we were foolish
Such a shame we couldn't see
We were foolish
Playing heart games just to bleed

All my memories are clouded by
Salty rivers, I don't cry, I'm tearless
I hide behind my entourage
Every day they tell me I am fearless

But when I close the door and I'm alone
The walls are closing in on me
It takes loneliness to see

That we were foolish
Such a shame we couldn't see
We were foolish
Playing heart games just to bleed

You are on your knees, you are naggin' me, for sure
But we can go back to where the foolish people go
Now I'm on my knees, and I'm naggin' you, for sure

No one ever tells you how to play
See different people
Go different ways
Some of them will leave you but
Some of them will stay

Well our hearts keep drumming
And the years keep coming
Quicker than they’ve ever been
You’re sick of the same thing
But it’s quicker than changing
It's too late to begin

Well everybody’s running but
You don’t know where
Time is running thin
Everybody’s looking for somebody to love
But we’re scared to let them in

And I say oh oh oh

Am I here alone?
I say oh oh oh

Am I here alone?
Am I on my own?
Am I on my own?

Oh love
It comes and goes
But no one never tells you how to learn to let go

Some of them will hurt you but
Some of them won’t

Well the bridge is burning
And the wheel keeps turning
Quicker than it did before
Your heart screams ""yes""
Your head says ""no""
And you’re never really sure

Well everybody’s running
But you don’t know why
Time is running short
Everybody’s looking for a place to hide
So there’s no one left at all

If this is redemption, why do I bother at all

Still I'd rather be working at something, than praying for the rain

Swam in the ocean, slept on my own
At dawn I would watch the sun cut ribbons through the bay
I'd remember all the things my mother wrote

That we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
Never once has any man I've met been able to love
So if I were you, I'd have a little trust

Two thousand years, I've been in that water
Two thousand years, sunk like a stone
Desperately reaching for nets
That the fishermen have thrown
Trying to find, a little bit of hope
Me I was holding, all of my secrets soft and hid
Pages were folded, then there was nothing at all
So if in the future I might need myself a savior
I'll remember what was written on that wall

That we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
Never once has any man I've met been able to love
So if I were you, I'd have a little trust

Am I an honest man, and true?
Have I been good to you at all?
Oh, I'm so tired of playing these games
We'd just be running down
The same old lines, the same old stories of
Breathless trains and worn down glories
Houses burning, worlds that turn on their own

So we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
Never once has any man I've met been able to love
So if I were you my friend, I'd learn to have just a little bit of trust"

Memory so bright

I can't change your thoughts, my dear
I can't change your fears
But if you want, I'll travel near
To make it disappear

I'll be there in the summer
'Cause your heart isn't safe
You won't go, you're not a runner
So you won't run away
If you could follow your heart gently
You wouldn't be in this mess
Maybe someday, just someday you'll find a way back

Your dreams are incredibly loud tonight
You're creating forest fires
You can't even change your sight
It's stuck in you like a virus

I can't change your thoughts, my dear

But if you want, I'll travel near
To make it disappear

And they always be smokin' like a Rasta

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison
Act a fool on stage
I prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (car)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band""
Now she actin' outta pocket
Tryna grab up from my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend

And they ain't got on no bra (bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, ""no more"" (more)
They like, ""Savage, why you got a 12 car garage
When you only got 6 cars?""
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that?
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks

Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard

This is a waltz
Thinking about our bodies

For our salvation
With only the clothes
That we stand up in
Just the ground
On which we stand
Is the darkness
Ours to take?
Bathed in lightness
Bathed in heat

All is well
As long as we keep spinning
Here and now
Dancing behind a wall
Hear the old songs
And laughter within
All forgiven
Always and never been true

When I arrive
Will you come and find me?
Or in a crowd
Be one of them?
Mother wants us
Back beside her
No tomorrows
At peace"

Coming in from the cold, to settle an old score

Gone overnight like the weather
Magic days of childhood I took for granted
Now I see were held together by a thread

And here I am
On the run again

Smears away our love with a smile

We all running the same race

Staring monsters in their face (with grace)

Well, how can we ask for more?
We might make love in some sacred place

And no answer has been found

And when you come to the table
To lay your burdens down
As you wait upon the weary
For whom no rest was found
As you search for to lean on
And find no friend around

And you feel like falling down

And no one is around
As you raise your hands above you
And from your lips cry out
Oh Father forgive me
For I could not see through my doubt
May you stand, stand your ground

And may you stand, stand your ground

And your light is burning out

I'm riding up the heights of shame
I'm waiting for the call, the hand on the chest
I'm ready for the fight and fate

The sound of iron shots is stuck in my head
The thunder of the drums dictates
The rhythm of the falls the number of deaths
The rising of the horns ahead
From the dawn of time to the end of days
I will have to run away
I want to feel the pain, and the bitter taste
Of the blood on my lips again

This deadly burst of snow is burning my hands

Are you really here
Or am I dreaming?
I can't tell dreams from truth
For it's been so long
Since I have seen you
I can hardly remember your face anymore
When I get really lonely
And the distance causes only silence
I think of you smiling
With pride in your eyes
A lover that sighs

If you want me
Satisfy me
If you want me
Satisfy me

Are you really sure
That you'd believe me
When others say I lie?
I wonder if you could
Ever despise me
You know I really try
To be a better one
To satisfy you
For you're everything to me
And I do what you ask me
If you let me be free

If you want me
Satisfy me

In my head
I found I’m in the thick of it
Forming threads
From my hands
Lead me back, I’ll follow it
I got my eyes on the horizon
I let the seed grow in my mouth
Bite my hunger
Let my mind, wild
In the Jungle, wild
Bite my hunger
Let my mind, ride
With the thunder, wild
Fell asleep
All a dream
Awoke to hear it calling me
Final leap
I’m on my feet
I’ve no idea where this will lead…

So I have this dream, it comes like twice in a week
It’s been so for years and years on repeat
And since then I’ve not had a full night of sleep
'Cause it plays out the same way
I live with this girl and our kid
I’m as happy as a pig rolled in shit
It’s postcard, I’m settled, a pirate no more
A gypsy at most with no mortgage
It’s boring but in the most exquisite of ways
No carcinogenic and humdrum malaise
And it’s strange, all the things that I’ve run from
Are the things that completeness could come from

So anyways, we’re happy and impossibly so
It’s earth and it’s heaven, all simpatico
Floorboards laid out and the walls painted white
My dream self and I like the same things
They’re all set to leave and I kiss them goodbye
They go and get groceries or something and I
Am drinking alone in the basement
And pray I’m not hallucinating

Do not let this thing you got go to waste
Do not let your heart be dismayed
It’s here by some random disclosure of grace
From some vascular, great thing
Let your life grow strong and sweet to the taste
'Cause the odds are completely insane
Do not let your spirit wane
Do not let your spirit wane
No, no, no, no, no, no

In love, I am careful to mostly reserved
And this dream is a life I don’t think I deserve
My girl and our kid are impossibly bright
And I am just drunk in my basement
See a car, see my girl and look at our kid
Approaching a corner, with rain and a skid
Then a phone call to me from the ICU ward
""Sir, I’m so sorry to say this""
I’m walking alone through the hospital door
ID their bodies, collapse to the floor
Numb and relentlessly broken
Then I wake up the very next moment

Do not let this thing you got go to waste
Do not let your heart be dismayed
It’s here by some random disclosure of grace
From some vascular, great thing
Do not let this thing you got go to waste
The pain and the beauty, so strange
Do not let your spirit wane
Do not let your spirit wane

Cut me out, take me home
My hands are tired, my legs are broke
And the ruptured chrome plus the deep unknown
Turn my insides out and my head face down
Cut me out, take me home
My hands are tired, my legs are broke
And the ruptured chrome plus the deep unknown
Turn my insides out and my head face down

Do not let this thing you got go to waste
Do not let your heart be dismayed
It’s here by some random disclosure of grace
From some vascular, great thing
Get the fuck out of your head if it says
“Stay cold and be deathly afraid”
Do not let your spirit wane
Do not let your spirit wane"

If the heavens ever did speak
She's  the last true mouthpiece

A fresh poison each week

Command me to be well

I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get somethin' shiny
Somethin' meaty for the main course
That's a fine-lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful

Before she finally learns?
That every single word they say is fake
And when they leave it burns
I've got nothing left so you can take it
Promise me you'll tell me when you're done
But if you find some hope you better break it

I don't like the feeling when you make me jealous
I don't like the weakness, I don't like to lie

Every time I wanna talk you make it so impossible
Even when I'm innocent you're holding me responsible
Strip another piece of me, take away my dignity
Never show me sympathy and maybe I will learn
Maybe I will learn

How many fires must a girl walk through
Before it finally rains?
Will she wake up on the other side
Once the water drains?
Tell me all this fighting has a meaning
'Cause I can't find the point of what we've done
If you care enough you better leave me

And flesh and bones
Takes it's tole

Feel the darkness fall
Everything we had's been torn apart
Oh, only bite and nickel does remain
Only flesh and bones
Flesh and bones

The floors have been quiet
No more pieces to claim
Stillness is sleek between our frames
Remember the pressure
Feeling the ache
Long been a masterpiece our grain
And flesh and bones
Takes it's tole

Feel the darkness fall
Everything we had's been torn apart
Oh, only bite and nickel does remain
Only flesh and bones
Flesh and bones

Tension building
Long before
These are the signs
The cracks in the boards
I realize to know is why this damage
No reason to change
Day turned to night

Feel the darkness fall
Everything we had's been torn apart
Oh, only bite and nickel does remain
Only flesh and bones

Damn
Thought I was someone
Thought we were something
It's always hard to understand
When every feeling
Leaves with no reason
Can't even balance no more
'Cause I put all my weight on you

But you're gone
Don't care how much I try
You're gone
And I'm not too surprised
You're gone
When you're all that's on my mind
You're gone
You're gone

Damn
I poured the concrete
You laid the ceiling
And it hurts to tear it down
But our home is empty
And all of the memories
I keep trying to erase
But I spent all my change on you

But you're gone
Don't care how much I try
You're gone
And I'm not too surprised
You're gone
When you're all that's on my mind
You're gone

How did a feeling so strong
End up just feeling so wrong?
Answers to questions I want

But you're gone
Don't care how much I try

And I'm not too surprised

Guess I never gave you my best
Your not undeserving
And I’m under serving  with all of the hurting I caused
Apply a fresh new set of paint
Cover up the scars
But the cracks keep expanding
It’s been like this too long
Can I keep carrying on
All the time wasted on me
Been living with cracks in the walls
The windows are broken
I wrecked it all
It seems you were right all along
I’ve had enough
The rooms are in ruin and I
Feel like I’ve been trapping us both inside
The foundation built on fault lines
Just wreck it all
I’ll burn it down from inside
Stoking the fire till the embers grow lighter engulfing my eyes
Watch as flames carry strong and fast
Our memories together all reduced to ash
I choke on smoke that fills my lungs
Try to breathe some air
You are my past in the flames
I’m always living this nightmare

Been living with cracks in the walls
The windows are broken
I wrecked it all
It seems you were right all along
I’ve had enough
The rooms are in ruin and I
Feel like I’ve been trapping us both inside
The foundation built on fault lines
Just wreck it all
It's time I melt away
The pain I’ve caused
The time we lost
And all along you watched it fall
I’ve been living with these cracks in the walls
I tore them down cause they never built me up
I’m surrounded yet fucking empty
Release me from this I’m going crazy

And be brave, you'll make it through one more time

To be full and pure
A little birdie came and sang a song to me
She said, we may be in the cage
But the cage is not in us
Don't you let nobody hold you back
No cage is strong enough to bind me
And God has the perfect timing
And then tomorow your cage is coming
So tomorrow your time is coming

Well, she wore you like silk
Bandaged all around
The scars of your love
Became your hollow crown
And she held you through the night
And kissed you through the cold
Blinded by your light
Just waiting to grow old

She said, love, I'd give you everything

Oh, love, well I'd do anything
And I'd do anything to be seen

So when you packed all of your bags
And left without a word
Well, the voices in her head
Were begging to be heard
So she wept all through the night
And slept all through the day
'Cause her lonely, lonely heart
Was caught in every trap you laid

And she said, love, I'd give you everything
I'd give you everything that you need
Oh, love, well I'd do anything
Yes, I'd do anything to be seen

They let you finish your meal
I know you'd like to believe it, baby
But you're more kid than criminal
Just a boy who could not
Get through a domestic flight
Without lighting up in the restroom
Got caught, cloud of smoke, thumb still on the light
You looked so proud
Couldn't wait to call a friend
We had to fly back home
Never got the money back for that weekend
Right there on the Sydney tarmac
I threw my luggage down
I said, ""I'm gonna leave you
I'm not a good woman when you're around""
That's when the sound came in
I could finally see
I felt the changing of the seasons
All of my senses rushing back to me
Go your own way
Watch me turn my own head
Eyes on the driver, hands in my lap
Heading to the city to get my body back

I remembered early days
When you took my camera
Turned to me, twenty-three
Naked on your bed, looking straight at you
Do you still have that photograph?
Would you use it to hurt me?

The traveler’s son they come askin’
Where he came from
‘Cause they’ve watched him
Washing his face near the pond
A curious boy and they wonder
Where he came from
He says: ""'I, I have seen the world’s most beautiful places
Still I feel, as If I’m a walking machine
Watching it all through a screen
There is nothing in between
To me
This might as well not be real""
Imagine, the girls take him up on a hill
It’s an Indigo night, there’s a chill
The boy is confused but he’s still
As they gather around him
So many of them, they all sing
About the pleasures of life
And he cries: ""Why can’t I sing along with some feeling, or some meaning?
It feels like I’ve always been blind
I don’t know why you girls are so kind
For there are so many in line
Whose lives aren’t as lost as mine”


Now something happened there
The smell of the grass, or maybe the air
There was no more despair
Just something about that night
Maybe the girls, they lit some light
And made everything right
‘Cause he’s never been
More alive"

Nor cares for falling tears or rain

With bundled arms and hands that fail
Till the last lifting of the veil
And the first openin' of the gate

Oh, I can’t wait any longer
To see our bodies grow stronger

For all the pain our hearts couldn’t contain
And so we’ll finally emancipate
Away from all our weakness

The day that we’ll be made of iron veins
We will remember of what our pain is made
And so we’ll finally emancipate
Away from the world weakness

The little bit of what we know is not enough
So we resign to live through love
Or own a bit of soil from this earth
And wish for the better tomorrow

These burning aches in my heart
They’re tearing me all apart
Oh, how I wish we could restart
And build a land without sorrow

And I'll do anything I have too

And I'll do anything I have to, to be far away
Dressed in these lullabies
Tell me I'm someone, somewhere else
I wish away your taste
Live out this alibi, end all my suffering
One big nothing, nothing
One big nothing, nothing

Looking back over my shoulder
I fear you're not far behind
And every day you're getting closer
Am I out of time?
Will anybody even notice the blood all over the hands?
'Cause it's bringing into focus

That I'll do anything I have to, to be far away
Dressed in these lullabies
Tell me I'm someone, somewhere else
I wish away your taste
Live out this alibi, end all my suffering
One big nothing, nothing
One big nothing, nothing

I gotta let you go, go, go
'Cause every day I don't, don't, don't
My body will lie to me
And I will never go back home
Make a future of my own
I think of you last as, I think of the past as
One big nothing
One big nothing, nothing

One big nothing, nothing
One big nothing, nothing"

Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watchin' in slow motion as you turn around and say

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watchin', I keep waitin', still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning to some secret place to hide
Watchin' in slow motion as you turn to me and say

Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Waking up next to you in the middle of the week
Never needed anyone to send me off to sleep
And I know I said, ""Go slow""
But I can't hold back no more
Got a premonition this ain't gonna be a fling

You make a weekend feel like a year
Baby, you got me changing
24-7, I want you here
I hope you feel the same thing

I want you to be the one that's on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
I want you to be there on a Monday night
Tuesday night, every night
Are you gonna be the one that's on my mind?
3-6-5, all the time
I want you to be the one to stay
And give me the night and day

Love it when you come back and can't take it when you leave
Got me fantasizing our initials already
And I wanna just let go
Fall in deeper than before
Say that you are ready, lock it up in a heartbeat

I want you to be the one that's on my mind
On my mind, on my mind

I guess you were on your own
Follow your dreams to a place
A space, the grace, that takes you home
You don't have to tell me once or twice
Wonder why we're here
We just gotta stop the flood
Before we lose it all and drown from fear

But let me tell you

I fought the war
Now it's time to go home

Let me tell you

Walking through the dark
Alone, no clothes, striking a light
Burning for the heat, the fire
The sparks, the love, to keep me alive
I'm captured for a gift
The thrill is how they live
One way track to hurt and to forgive
So I lift my head, open my arms
Give a sword to my heart

I said, let me tell you
I'm ready to fly
I've survived through rainstorms, sandstorms
I fought the war
Now it's time to go home

Feed me water
Walk me through the hills
Wait until the sun shines upon us

Sailed around its ring

And I crowned myself it’s king

Carved christ in ivory

To justify myself all the bleeding
I clawed myself a nation
And I’ve shopped its waterways
I crack the dirt for smoking out
Rhymes of energy
I gouge myself a pipeline
I dig myself a mine
I take myself a forest
To sap the growing up of your shrine
I’ve halted ghosts from dancing
Swept the prayers from the last ones left
And I kept the drums from breathing
It’s I that warped the blankets’ web
I that warp the blankets web

To speak in some such candor
I rip from the condor’s wing
I feed on loving bodies
And take the land from them to stanch their living
Take the land from them to stanch the living"

So we slow motion at once

Mon cœur regarde en lui s'il s'étire en longueur

Ceux qui m'ouvrent leur cœur

Oh ça me plait, ça me plait, ça me plait, ça me désespère

Inventeurs précurseurs de la discipline
Je suis accrédité à la médiocrité
Autant passer mon tour j'avais et j'ai toujours d'autres priorités
Et qu'on me tienne la main et je suis prisonnier
Qu'on me parle tout bas
Et je regarde en l'air
Moi je me fous comme il faut du langage amoureux
Car j'en refuse les closes
Comme d'avoir sur les choses un seul avis pour deux

All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need

The siren called beyond the treeline
With another one for the caves
And in the tarn beyond those birches
There's a spirit that I crave
And from the island, people watched you
You set that viking ship ablaze
We reached the moon, fall's icy cauldron
And found the spirit that I crave

All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need

You've fallen barefoot past the treeline
Beaten, bone-eyed, butchered, swayed
A thousand whitefish floating belly up
In the spirit that I crave
And we threw ourselves right into it
Where lay the bodies had been claimed
We dove a third out for the fifth
Banned to the spirit that I crave

All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need

I found empathy from madness
Deliverance from malaise
My heart is is filled with gladness
At the only spirit that I crave

All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine

And crying, crying, you know we're playing to a full house, house

While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone

But in the end for you and me
Oh, the show, it can't go on

We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause, oh
And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow
Oh, it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show

We're crying, crying, so let the velvet roll down, down

It was upon a row of houses
Tight skirts and baggy trousers
Green men and cheap disguises
High hopes and higher rises
Who lived a girl who was on a mission
Who lived a boy who was under suspicion
Tried hard to stay beside her
Until the devil put his seed inside her
How? You know how
Sleep too long and the sand runs out
So close to midnight
Time to fly, do or die
Stoned in the headlights

Here we lie, high and dry
The world will never see you 'til you open your eyes
Say goodnight, kill the light
The world will never hear you tonight
Idlewild

For two years, he tried to reach her
Worshipped the ground beneath her
She, she was always runnin'
He, he saw the end was comin'
But now the story takes a turn and
She wakes up and her sheets are burnin'
Head down against the fire
Now, now, now the table turns
She won't learn
Sleep too long and your bed starts burnin'
So close to midnight
Idlewild, you don't know
You never need to

Here we lie, high and dry
The world will never see you 'til you open your eyes
Say goodnight, kill the light
The world will never hear you tonight
Idlewild (Do, do, do, do)
Idlewild (Do, do, do, do)

I thought that we were good together
I thought that we could weather the weather
Whether or not, the why's the word for us
The high hopes are only there because, because
Because I thought the only thing between us
Was somethin' shallow, not a river so deep, we see us
Dredge up the wreckage our parents left us
Lay it on the banks to rot and fester
Now its skeleton hangin' like a Death Star
In Gretna Green, Darby, Manchester
And I don't want to hear it now

Here we lie, high and dry
The world will never see you 'til you open your eyes
Say goodnight, kill the light
The world will never hear you tonight

Why did you think you could ever put me down ?

Cause me, myself and I
Give each other alibis
Care to try pull the wool over my eyes

Oh life, it's bigger
It's bigger than you, and you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight, losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Every whisper of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost, and blinded fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I've said enough

Consider this
Consider this the hint of the century
Consider this
The slip that brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around?
Now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try?
That was just a dream, just a dream

To wake up to a bedroom filled with light

The police met the plane
They let you finish your meal
I know you'd like to believe it, baby
But you're more kid than criminal
Just a boy who could not
Get through a domestic flight
Without lighting up in the restroom
Got caught, cloud of smoke, thumb still on the light
You looked so proud
Couldn't wait to call a friend
We had to fly back home
Never got the money back for that weekend
Right there on the Sydney tarmac
I threw my luggage down
I said, ""I'm gonna leave you
I'm not a good woman when you're around""
That's when the sound came in
I could finally see
I felt the changing of the seasons
All of my senses rushing back to me
Go your own way
Watch me turn my own head
Eyes on the driver, hands in my lap
Heading to the city to get my body back

I remembered early days
When you took my camera
Turned to me, twenty-three
Naked on your bed, looking straight at you
Do you still have that photograph?
Would you use it to hurt me?
Well, I guess it's just my life
And it's just my body

I guess it's just my life
And it's just my body

After all I drifted ashore, through the streams of oceans
Whispers wasted in the sand
As we were dancing in the blue, I was synchronized with you
But now the sound of love is out of tune

Je ferais la pute dans le coin d'une rue

Tout l’monde était là mais personne n'a rien dit

Au petit matin j'ai quitté le nid
Pris mon envol petit à petit

When you come dead last
In battles long past
Intended to rip my heart out
Oracle of your secrets
Your eye was trained on me
As I stood before you, unbuttoning
Kiss me as the bell tolls
Swiftly, as the horses ride

Won't you dance?
Won't you dance?
Won't you dance?
Won't you dance?

Damn my dreams, the tormentors
Last night your mouth was on my skin
And the poppies were like fire on the mountain
I took your hand and led you home
All my old ways have started kickin' in
And my bad days are comin' round again
Left here in American darkness
River on fire and sun eclipsed

Won't you dance?
Won't you dance?
Won't you dance?
Won't you dance?

Strange, I've seen that face before
I’ve seen him hanging around my door
Like a hawk stealing for the prey
Like the night waiting for the day

Strange, he shadows me back home
His footsteps echo on the stones
Rainy nights, on Haussmann Boulevard
Parisian music drifting from the bars


Dance in bars and restaurants
Home with anyone who wants
Strange, he's standing there alone
His staring eyes chill me to the bone"

They don't trouble the waters my love
Frozen in time
Fragile to touch
She melts like the words on my tongue
The goddess of heavenly love
Fades out of sight

All your stars are in view
I get lost loving you (Flame)

Dark was the night
Her shape burned a void in my eyes
It was black but so violently bright
Like the birth of a sun
So I cried out
But my voice could not be heard aloud
For held here safe in my mouth
The bird was done

All your stars are in view

He's always in three places
Spaces undefined
Heart is always racin'
For something he will never find
Eyes are black
Black and cold
His soul has been shaken
So shaken
I believe he knows
The sun could never reach him
The view looks like a bomb
The paradox is far away
His brain weighs at least a ton
His mind is so stressed out
Tryin' to be a king
When everyone around him
Sees the clown and
They're laughing at him
Look at this idiot
Don't know he's been set up to fall
Can't find the truth in any friend
And all he ever does is want drugs

This world is drunk
And the people are mad
This world is drunk
And the people are mad
This world is drunk, ooh
This world is drunk and
This world is drunk and the people are mad

He doesn't get a listen
Not even to himself
He spent 4 years away
Was led astray
Convicted for fraud
He said he knows more now
Now that he returned
The books that he read there
Told him he had gone too far
He's always feeling left out
And he always left his friends out
He never understood why
That most of his friends are just bums
He's tryna live better now
He says he needs that family life
He can tell he wasted much time
Winter time has taken his life
And making him miserable
He never feels he's in control
He finds it hard to walk away
So all he ever does is stay drunk

This world is drunk
And the people are mad
So mad

And the people are mad
So mad

And if you're feeling paranoid
What the hell does that mean?
You'd rather be alone, anonymously
If I'm such a freakazoid
Unable to breathe, breathe, breathe
Do we move along or wait and see?

I believe you're trying to keep us all from dying

Can I pull you home away from the middle of the road?
Another safety zone, another way to know
And this freakazoid who needs a little relief, relief, relief
Knows you're not alone and wants you to believe

I believe you're trying to keep us all from dying
(Keep us all from dying)
I believe you're crying to keep this whole thing flying
(Whole thing comes up flying)
Oh me, oh my, it seems you might be lying

I'll keep on fighting as long as you keep trying

Once again with a little more love
Once again, I believe, believe, believe

Why do I deserve the science?
To feel better about You?
At a loss, I lost my cool
I denied that I found You
I tried to be a basket case
I did not surprise You
I'm trying to find a signal fire
Let me know when I should move

But You, amplified in the silence
Justified in the way You make me bruise
Magnified in the science
Anatomically proved that You don't need me
(There is nothing You keep, there is only Your reflection)
(There is nothing You keep, there is only Your reflection)

Why do I desire the space?
I was mourning after You
I was lost and lost my shape
There was nothing I could do
I don't want to waste away
It was all I gave to You
Take me back and take my place
I will rise right up for You

But You, amplified in the silence
Justified in the way You make me bruise
Magnified in the science
Anatomically proved that You don't need me

All the while you waste away, you're asking
""Did I really need another one to take me down?""
Everybody knows it's something that you had to live with, darling
Nobody's gonna tear you down now
There is nothing You keep, there is only Your reflection
(There is nothing You keep, there is only Your reflection)

There was nothing but quiet retractions
And families pleading, ""Don't look in that cabinet
There's far more bad than there's good, I don't know how it got there""
That was something your father had burned in me
Twenty hours out of Homestake eternity
""You can go anywhere but you are where you came from""
Little girl, you are cursed by my ancestry
There is nothing but darkness and agony
I can not only see, but you stopped me from blinking
Let me watch you as close as a memory
Let me hold you above all the misery
Let me open my eyes and be glad that I got here
There is nothing You keep, there is only Your reflection"

If you know that, it's force of habit
Take something from it
You called, it came
It's here to stay
These wounds don't heal
But they won't show

They've already been out there
They've been walking for miles
There's nobody out there
So don't waste your time

It's over a choice that you made
It's taken you nowhere
You called, they came
They're here to stay

I've seen it from your side, but
Still takes a moment to realize
These situations they often arise

They say it's impossible to know, but I know
Keep my head low
Decide on it once and for all
So now you know
They say it's impossible to grow, but I've grown
Read the headstone
Confide in it once and for all

You know that it's force of habit
Take something from it
You called, they came
They're here to stay

I've seen it from both sides, but
I need the moment to understand why
These situations always arrive
(I've) I've seen it with my own eyes, but
Still takes a moment to realize why
These situations they often arise

Been bitten twice as shy or
One thing or another, but no one asks, ""Why?""
These complications get me tired
(I've) Been bitten, still too shy or
One thing to another along those lines
I bid you well, do as you might

(I've) Been bitten twice as shy or
One thing or another, but no one asks, ""Why?""
These complications get me tired
(I've) I've seen it with my own eyes but
Still takes a moment to realize why
These situations they often arise

Been bitten twice as shy or
One thing or another that no one asks, ""Why?""
These complications get me tired
(I've) I've seen it all with my own eyes, but
Still takes a moment to realize why
These situations they often arise"

You shot your poison dart

You took my innocence

Lost the melody in my head

Je me lève le matin
Un café dans ma main
Et c'est ben gris dehors
Je lis les nouvelles
Ça m'énerve
Toujours la fin du monde
Je retourne dans mon lit
Pas besoin de faux sourire
Sous le son de la pluie
Mais je suis bien
Quand je me cache
En dessous de la mélancolie
En dessous de la mélancolie
Pas d'attente
Facilement content
Pas besoin de m'soûler avec ta poésie
Pas besoin d'être triste pour être tranquille
Et bien dans le silence
La solitude
C'est un câlin trop long et trop bien

J'entends les gens dehors
Crisse, le monde sont ben trop énervés pour moi
Pis mes murs qui shake à cause d'mes voisins qui baisent
J'espère j'ai pas un parking ticket
Mais je suis trop bien
Je suis trop bien
En dessous de cette mélancolie
Et je suis trop bien
En dessous de cette mélancolie
Y'a quelque chose qui chante
Parfaites comme vous êtes
Moi et moi-même
Comme à la fin du monde"

'Cause I still think about the old days
In the city with my own fate
Twenty-five, don’t feel the same way
The streets keep changing names

We all spent time now at your mom's place
On the West Side in the fall haze
All of our stories went the same way
When we had time to waste

And I think that I'm falling
I’m tripping and I'm crawling
It feels like rather often
The years do come to pass
And I keep getting older
My mind is getting colder
The things that all once mattered
I know for sure won't last"

And it fills a void
With a sense of wonder

Easier to make mistakes
There's a great feeling
That there's no longer anything at stake
When it's all temporary
Everything out here
Is made of the possibility
To dissapear
No ordinary people

From the day you see
It's all temporary
You stop looking for love
Start looking the barriers
The barriers you hold
To keep love from coming
Touch everything you see
Very very lightly

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

But now it isn't true
Now, everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me...

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion

Told us we would see all our dreams and plans unfold

And apologise to you until the day it went rotten

Looking at you like a star
From a place the world forgot

And there's nothing that I can do
Except bury my love for you

To bury my love in the moondust
I long to hear your voice, but still I make the choice
To bury my love in the moondust

Nothing can breathe in the space
Colder than the darkest sea
I have dreams about the days
Drivin' through your sunset breeze

And the first thing that I will do
Is bury my love for you

The brightness of the sun will give me just enough
To bury my love in the moondust
I long to hear your voice, but still I make the choice
To bury my love in the moondust

I'm a castaway and men reap what they sow
And I say what I know to be true
Yeah I'm livin' far away on the face of the moon
I've buried my love to give the world to you

The brightness of the sun will give me just enough

Counting down in twos and in threes
With never a word, out loud

There's trouble
Trouble ahead
Sun's going down, and come back up again
Cry cry
Momma is crying
She's here
There's trouble ahead
I know
What that evil do
Come down from a mountain
To where the river run
Boys in the water
And tell no one
Ohh, what I know, what that evil done

Redemption ain't coming around no more
Somone's banging
Banging down the door
What a fearful sound
I've never heard before
Mmm, sweet redemption, ain't coming around no more

Mmm, there's trouble, trouble ahead
It's all going down
And coming back up again
Cry cry
Momma is crying
Mmm, she said
Trouble

He took me for a ride
In the late hours of the night
Oh, what a fearful sight
Blood in the water
And oh he came to be
My blackest memory
He washed his hands to me
Now there's blood in the water

He said: Don’t do this
Forgive me
He's begging me for mercy
I looked him in the eye
Gave him a crooked smile
Put him out of my misery
And now there's

Blood, blood, blood in the water
In the water
Blood in the water
Blood, blood, blood in the water
In the water
Blood in the water
Down, down, down to the devil you goes
In the water
Blood in the water

And when the lawmen came
He asked me to explain
Just how my lover boy came
To lie in the water
I said: It was no crime
He was no love of mine
His blood was the coldest kind
Now it’s all in the water

He said: Don't do this
Forgive me
Was begging me for mercy
I looked him in the eye
Gave him a crooked smile
Put him out of my misery
And now there's

Blood, blood, blood in the water
In the water
Blood in the water
Blood, blood, blood in the water

Down, down, down to the devil you goes

You would use your songs to say

There is no other love, it's only yours
You're all I want, all the love

And with Cristal and pink champagne
On our wedding day
You had a Hollywood sign made of cocaine for us
Then you got on top of it
And you sang to me
As the snow was falling

When May was all in bloom
And who should he see

Washing her white marble stone
She whooped
She hollered
She called so loud
She waved her lily-white hand
""Come hither to me

He put his bent bow down by Brent-side
And across the river sprang he
He gripped his hands
Round her middle so small
And he kissed her red ruby lips
Then he rode home to his father's own house
Loudly knocked at the ring
""Arise, arise my father!"" he cried
""Rise and please let me in!""
""Oh arise, arise, dear mother,"" he cried
""Rise and make up my bed!""
""Arise, arise, dear sister,"" he cried
""Get a napkin to tie round my head.""

""For, if I should die tonight
As I suppose I shall
Please bury me 'neath that white marble stone
That lies 'neath fair Ellender's hall.""
Fair Ellender sat all in her hall
Weaving her silk so fine
Who should she see, but the finest corpse
That ever her eyes shone on
Oh, Fair Ellender called on her head maid:
(Oh, oh George Collins...
Oh, oh, his sake...) (x4)
""Whose corpse is this oh so fine?""
She made her reply:
""George Collins' corpse;
An old, true lover of mine.""
""Put him down, my brave little boys
And open his coffin so wide
That I may kiss his red ruby lips,""
(Oh George Collins' sake...)
""Ten thousand times they've kissed mine.""
The news being carried to fair London town
Wrote on London gate
""Six pretty maids died all in one night
And all for George Collins' sake."""

And the stars give a light
In a little while it will be day
The voice of love it calls upon us all
And bids us awake and pray
Rise, arise, wake thee arise
Life she is calling thee
For it might be the mothering of your sweet soul
If you open your eyes and see
That the life of a man it comes with little plan
It flourishes like a flower
As tender in the heart into which you’re born
So cherish your every hour
The summertime is coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie go
And we’ll all go together
To pluck wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
For our time is not long
Time’s an old folk song
No longer can we stay
Those that remember say
Blessed are you all
Who make it through this brawl
Long life and another good year

Blessed are you all
Who answer to the call
Long life and another good year
Long life and another good year
For the moon shines bright
And the stars will be our height
Life she is calling thee
Rise, arise, wake thee arise
And ever more watchful be"

Lay your head where my heart used to be
Hold the earth above me
Lay down in the green grass
Remember when you loved me

Come closer, don't be shy
Stand beneath a rainy sky
The moon is over the rise
Think of me as a train goes by

Clear the thistles and brambles
Whistle ""Didn't He Ramble""
Now there's a bubble of me
And it's floating in thee

God took the stars and he tossed them
Can't tell the birds from the blossom
You'll never be free of me
He'll make a tree from me

Stand in the shade of me
Things are now made of me
The weather vane will say
""It smells like rain today""

Don't say goodbye to me
Describe the skies to me
And when the sky falls, mark my words
We'll catch a mockingbird"

Feels life is like a game of roulette

You were my compass
Now I've turned sideways
Maybe you turn to ashes, ashes

When it all comes down

A cold wind sits, upon my back
The sky is getting full and turning black
I lost my way
When I lost you
I need a moment more, this can't be true

Help me see beyond the surface

Little girl, just keep on waiting
For that man to give you a life
You keep on hoping, so this prince can save you
Keep on dreaming his scandalous lie
For your love, is he the hero? Mmm
Does he know that you begging him please?
Where angels dare, the devils fill that need
In your despair does he get up to leave?

At the start of his goodbye
Do you ever realize
That you'll never get the chance
All you get is alibis
When smoke begins to fade
And you're standing face to face
Does he kiss you in a way to say
""You're the other woman""
The other woman

Wear that dress, the one you rely on, mmm
Slip up high, that shows off your wares
And when he's arriving, give him that invitation
Keep on wishing on his dollars and cares
For your love, he is your hero, yes
Even though you are begging him please, please
Woman I'm scared your risks are never ending
And don't you pretend you don't live what you breathe

At the start of his goodbyes
Do you ever realize
That you'll never get the chance
All you get is alibis
When smoke begins to fade
And you're standing face to face
Does he kiss you in a way to say
""You're the other woman""
The other woman
You'll always be the other woman
You'll always be the other woman

Baby, trust me, I've been there before
You don't know him, I know him more


At the start of his goodbye
Do you ever realize
That you'll never get the chance
All you get is alibis
When smoke begins to fade
And you're standing face to face
Does he kiss you in a way to say
""You're the other woman""
The other woman"

So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to believe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I can feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say, forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love
There's no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run, I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, mind, body, and soul
How can it be you're asking me
To feel the things you never

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
There's something missing in my heart"

Waking up too soon
The pale blue light of your hotel room
The restless city air
Blends with the traces of your perfume

The only memory I'll be keeping
As I see the way
While you pretend to be sleeping
I need to know
You and me go where we want to go

Don't tell on me
Be still my thieving heart
Breaking down every door
Is nothing holy no more
I think I know just
What you're longing for
You're so much colder
Than you were before
Oh my thieving heart
Oh my thieving heart

I may be undone
But nothing seems to undo you
You're the lucky one
It seems to pass right on through you
Oh be rich no more
We both know what we've got ourselves into
Oh don't you start

Ooh, ooh
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

And now you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
I will survive, I will survive

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent so many nights feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained-up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Well now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?

As the radio plays old forgotten boleros
I think of the days when this city was mine
I remember the praise

""Ay, te adoro, te quiero,"" (Te adoro)
The neighborhood waved
And said, ""Nina, be brave (Te quiero)
And you're gonna be fine!"" (Respira)
And maybe it's me (Respira)
But it all seems like lifetimes ago
So what do I say to these faces that I used to know?
""Hey, I'm home?""

Mira, Nina

Hey...

No me preocupo por ella

They're not worried about me

Mira, allí esta nuestra estrella

They are all counting on me to succeed!

Ella sí da la talla

I am the one who made it out (Ah)
The one who always made the grade
But maybe I should have just stayed home (Mira, Nina)
When I was a child I stayed wide awake
Climbed to the highest place
On every fire escape
Restless to climb (Respira)
I got every scholarship
Saved every dollar
The first to go to college
How do I tell them why (Respira)
I'm coming back home? (Ah)
With my eyes on the horizon
Just me and the GWB
Asking, ""Gee Nina, what'll you be?""

Straighten the spine, smile for the neighbors
Everything's fine, everything's cool
The standard reply, ""Lots of tests, lots of papers""
Smile, wave goodbye, and pray to the sky, oh, god
And how do I dare to say...

Nina

Can I go in there and say...

Nina

""I know that I'm letting you down?""

Nina!

Just breathe"

Traveling in the headlights' direction
When love is getting too complicated
And you don’t wanna think about that
Because words can be so overrated

When I woke, I was there alone
Where will it end?
After the twilight, always a sunrise
But the glow of morning comes with small arms fire
Ignore the deadline, there's no divine right
Enter the gods and all the sacred signs
At the end of your line

Good luck, my friend
In time, it ends
Heads up, dead man
My heart, your hands
Good luck, my friend
In time, it ends
Heads up, dead man

Sitting on the same bed
I don't know where I'm going and it is
Getting late
Tell me, what is wrong now?
Tell me, what can we do about it?
Nothing stays the same

I guess I'll be gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 'til November
And if I belong-long-long-long-long-long, will I stay there?
It's one of those mornings after one of those nights
I guess I'll be gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone to make it right

You say you're gonna miss me
I don't know but it's making me feel
So far away
It's coming on slowly
I don't care how we got here
Because we ain't never going back

I guess I'll be gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 'til November
And if I belong-long-long-long-long-long, will I stay there?
It's one of those mornings after one of those nights
I guess I'll be gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone to make it right

Well at first I was afraid, I was petrified
I didn't think that I could live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew stronger, and I learned how to get along
And now you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you with that look upon your face
I should have changed the stupid lock
I should have asked you for the key
If I'd have known for just one minute you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Don't turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt mе with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survivе
For as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
I had to pick up all the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not the foolish little soul that's still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Well baby I'm saving all my love for someone who's loving me
Oh

Turn around, next thing you know

Oh, my God, I feel so bored
I'm startin' to realise that all the boys that I find
Are all trouble, I told my mother

What's your preference? 'Cause I know mine

And it's you
Foolish of me to say these things, but I want to

Don't need a reason when I see it all in you

Wearin' our jewels in the swimming pool
Me and my sister just playin' it cool
Under the chemtrails over the country club

Take out your turquoise and all of your jewels
Go to the market, the kids' swimming pools
Baby, what's your sign?
My moon's in Leo, my Cancer is sun
You won't play, you're no fun
Well, I don't care what they think
Drag racing my little red sports car
I'm not unhinged or unhappy, I'm just wild

There's nothing wrong contemplating God
Under the chemtrails over the country club
Wearin' our jewels in the swimming pool
Me and my sister just playin' it cool
Under the chemtrails over the country club

Meet you for coffee at the elementary schools
We laugh about nothing as the summer gets cool
It's beautiful how this deep normality settles down over me
I'm not bored or unhappy, I'm still so strange and wild

You're in the wind, I'm in the water
Nobody's son, nobody's daughter
Watching the chemtrails over the country club
Suburbia, The Brentwood Market
What to do next? Maybe we'll love it
White picket chemtrails over the country club

My love, my love

Washing my hair, doing the laundry
Late night TV, I want you on me
Like when we were kids under chemtrails and country clubs
It's never too late, baby, so don't give up
It's never too late, baby, so don't give up
Under the chemtrails over the country club, yeah (You're born in December and I'm born in June)

Why wait until tomorrow

On the empty road outside my window
Underneath the street lamp i saw you
In this quiet light there was no sorrow
Just illuminated by this moon

Others are attracted by the sunlight
Me, I’m drawn to darkness and the shade

Why wait until tomorrow
What you can do today
If you don’t do it now it will be too late
Why wait until tomorrow

If you don’t do it now

Sleep away the chaos that the sun brings
Waiting for our night time rendezvous
Making an appointment at the graveyard
Surrounded by the beauty of each tomb

And all the quiet nights
When summer had arrived
And we played Annie Over
Unburdened by concern
Appearing in my mind now

When boundless love and joy
Lived in our young hearts
And smiled inside our chests

In the middle of the desert
The devil trailing just behind

And it's a shame that I had to disappear

J'avais jamais vu de nuit aussi calme, hey

Ses larmes coulent en silence, on entend toujours les cigales
On se blesserait même avec zéro mot, pourtant aucun mur sur cette terre
Ne pourrait étouffer le cri de nos phéromones, on risque pas de tenir longtemps
Tu m'as même comparé à Lucifer, maint'nant, tu bois et tu veux bien de moi
Nan, mais j'hallucine, je sais déjà c'que la distance entraîne
Soit c'est la guerre pendant dix ans sans trêve, soit je la quitte en lui disant

Garde le sourire, plus rien n'est grave
Tant qu'il nous reste une seconde de souv'nir dans le crâne
Nos deux corps pourraient mourir, j'ai déjà fait le deuil
Maint'nant pars loin de moi, une larme cachée dans l'œil

Notre histoire n'aurait jamais pu finir dans le calme et la tendresse
Je te déteste comme cette phrase qui dit : ""C'était trop beau pour être vrai""
Je n'avouerai jamais que certaines de mes propres émotions m’effraient

Regarde-nous, le destin a pas honte, les dieux ont pas honte
J'ai tout foiré cette année, c'est toujours en chantier, est-c'qu'on peut rev'nir en janvier ?
Son regard me traverse le corps comme une longue aiguille, on dirait bien qu'on est cuits
Nous deux dans la même voiture, on fonce vers la mort, on s'déteste tellement qu'on refait l'amour
Parce que c'est comme de la drogue, on a d'quoi planer, sur son dos, mon torse fait de l'aquaplaning
Le problème, c'est qu'ça m'rappelle pourquoi je l'aime
Je revois le début, les premières semaines, on pourrait repartir à zéro
Et prendre le premier avion comme dans un f‌ilm de merde mais c'est du délire

Garde le sourire, plus rien n'est grave

I saw the way you made her feel like she should be somebody else
I saw the way she tried to hold you when your heart was just a shell
I saw the words she wrote that broke my heart, it was a living hell
I saw the way you laughed behind her back when you fucked somebody else
I saw the way you made her feel like she should be somebody else
I know you think the stars align for you and not for hеr as well
I understand, I can admit that I have fеlt those things myself

Lord, it’s a feeling
It comes to find you
Lord, it's a feeling
That I felt

If it's convenient for you, you want her love, she’ll give you more
That's when your words are so convincing, say, you'll try until she's sure
That you will change, I can admit that I have been right here before
But on that morning, when you're proud, you said, ""I fucked somebody, of course""

Lord, it's a feeling
It comes to find you
Lord, it's a feeling (That I felt)
It comes to find you (Like no one else)

They held me out every night
Well, I didn't have much to say
I didn't give up the light
I closed my eyes, I closed myself
I closed my world, I'll never open up to anything
That could hurt me at all
I had to close down everything
I had to close down my mind
Too many things could cut me
Too much could make me blind

So many heartaches, so many faces
So many dirty things

Pressing the poised feet of his mother who smiles at him as she sings
Yearning to belong yearning to belong
My heart beats with a ceaseless longing of a yearning to belong
In spite of myself and all of these nursery songs
My heart beats with a ceaseless longing of a yearning to belong

Till the melodies of childish days, are upon, upon me
And they take me back, back down the river
They keep leading me on, they lead me till I see
That all of my manhood is cast
Down in the flood of remembrance, and I weep like a child for the past

Pressing the poised feet of his mother who smiles at him as she sings

Cause he can still say every single day he's yearning to belong

And spit you out, take all your energy
And leave you in a drought

Call me cynical, I’d be surprised if you don’t
But if you knew everything that I’ve been through

But I can only blame myself
I’ve realised that it’s my own fault

Banging on a drum
You turned me loose
Maybe I'm the living proof
What have I been running from?

I went down to the corner
They're building up my block
Maybe I've been gone too long
I can't go back
Oh, lonesome
I will protect
I'll keep improving
Taking me home
I'm always changing
Now I suppose
I'm only moving
I'm in Chicago
Come to me now
I know the path
I know it's changing
I know the pain
The pain you've been feeling
I've been to the place
That you've tried escaping
I can't recall
What I believe in
I'm always changing
Love overflowing

But I'm rising
And I'm damaged
Oh, rising
Ooh"

You dug your own grave, now lie in it
You're so cruel
But revenge is a dish best served cold

Don't you know that you're better off dead

Les Champs Élysées brillent avec la lumière de l’Afrique
Des anges avec des gilets pare-balles vi-ser dans ma street
J’veux changer d'galaxie, même pas changer de pays
Mes paupières tremblent seules, j’suis nerveux comme le GTI
Des larmes sur le sol, du sang sur les murs
Si tu m'demandes qui je suis, j'te dirais qu'je suis perdu
Chacun pensе à soi ouai, chacun porte sa croix
J’fais confiance à personnе, j’ai vu The Wire trois fois
Les Champs Élysées brillent avec la lumière de l’Afrique
J’rappe le charme du ghetto, la misère de la street
J’les baise tout seul comme un grand, l’argent me va comme un gant
Le rap, c’était mieux avant qu'tu dises que le rap, c’est mieux avant

J’me rappelle du mal, j’me rappelle du bien
Mais j’me rappelle que tout va mieux quand j’me rappelle d'avant
J’me rappelle du mal, j’me rappelle du bien
Mais j’me rappelle que tout va mieux quand j’me rappelle de rien

J'ai des trous d'mémoire, j'ai des trous d'mémoire
Qu'est-c'que ça fait d'être heureux ? Je n'm'en souviens pas, j'ai des trous d'mémoire, non

Tu sais qu'j'suis riche mais tu sais qu'j'suis triste, Q7, X6, XN, XX

Les Champs Élysées brillent avec la lumière de l'Afrique
Les coins d'mon cœur sont noirs comme les ruelles de ma ville
Au fond du V.I.P, ce soir, c’est Vivastreet
Vu que j’trouverai pas l’amour non en haut des pyramides
Les Champs Élysées brillent avec les lumières de l’Afrique
J'n’ai plus peur de la mort, j’ai juste peur de la vie
Je rêve d’un mirage, je rêve d’Aaliyah
Je mange des quesadillas dans une caisse à dix liasses
Demain me parait bien mais demain me parait loin
Comment aimer un cœur en acier valyrien ?
Les Champs Élysées brillent avec la lumière de l’Afrique
Aujourd’hui, c’est le premier jour du reste de ma vie

J’me rappelle du mal, j’me rappelle du bien
Mais j’me rappelle que tout va mieux quand j’me rappelle d'avant

I stand straight like an angel with a halo
Hangin' out the Hilton Hotel window
Screamin', ""Hey, you, baby, let's go""
My chest, the Sierra Madre
My hips, every high and byway
That you trace with your fingertips like a Toyota
Run your hands over me like a Land Rover

In Arcadia, Arcadia
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That pump the blood that flows straight to the heart of me
America, America
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to you, Arcadia

My body is a map of LA
And my heart is like paper, I hate you
I'm not from the land of the palms, so I know I can't stay here
I'm not native, but
My curves, San Gabriel all day
And my lips like the fire licks the bay
If you think that you know yourself, you can come over
Lay your hands on me like you're a Land Rover

In Arcadia, Arcadia
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That get the blood flowing straight to the heart of me
America, I need a miracle
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to you, Arcadia

They built me up three-hundred feet tall just to tear me down
So I'm leavin' with nothing but laughter and this town
Arcadia
Findin' my way to you
I'm leavin' them as I was, five-foot-eight, Western belt
Plus the hate that they gave
By the way, thanks for that, on the way, I'll pray for you
But you'll need a miracle, America"

Cause I done a bad thing and I'm paying it for all right now
Oh I've done a bad thing and I'm paying it for all right now
Hey there doctor, tell me what do you see?
Cause I got a bad disease and need of your remedy
And I've been aching from my head to my toes
I've been aching so much that I just don't ache no more
But there is a one thing that I need you to see
And you ain't never met a man sick as me
Hey mister bartender
You see my tremblin' hands
You know I need a drink and I need it so bad
Cause I don't know...Lordy what I just done
But you got me burning like a foxchild rebel under the sun
And now I'm shaking from all my misery
Cause you ain't never met a man as wrong as me
And no, no, no, I dont lie
Cause I was taken over by the devil last night
And I know, know, know, when he come around
I've done a bad thing and I'm paying for it all right now
Hey mister Judge, you gonna lock me up
Cause I've been thinking things that I should not thinkin' of
Go and hide all your brothers, go and hide the knife (night?)
You got me creepin' though the dark in the middle of the lonely night
You'd better lock your door, n' throw away the key
Cause you ain't never met a man as guilty as me

And I no, no, no, I don't lie
Cause I was taken over by the devil last night
And I know, know, know, when he come around
And I've done bad a thing and I'm paying for it right now
And I no, no, no, I don't lie
Cause I was taken over by the devil last night
And I know, know, know, when he come around

That got me thinking
There's something we should talk about
It's not worth waiting out
I can give you space if you need it
You can walk away, I'm not leaving
There's pride in my mouth, I got used to the taste
But I'll swallow it now and I'll be first to say
Those green eyes are my green light
I'm giving up on control
You see red lights
I see me blowing straight through to you
If we're headed for the cliffside
I'm ready for the fall, if you know me at all
You know I don't need lights to decide
I'm not changing my mind
We could both play the pretender
Circling round this parking lot
While one of us still remembers
We're lucky to have what we've got

We're taking the room for breathing
You can walk away, I'm not leaving
There's pride in your mouth, you got used to the taste
Can you swallow it now when you hear me say

Don’t you know I wish that I could forget

But it’s a power keeps me holding on (Keeps me holding on)

Yeah they call me a fool

For your love baby
And I’ll be a fool any time
I’ll be a fool any time, any time for loving you

I’vе been wishing things had been different
But I guess thе cards, they fall the way they're meant
Win or lose or draw you play the hand you’re sent
Beggar, borrower, given, taken, lent
I’ve been drinking, staying drunk all day
Got me creeping but it’s not late at night
Got my life twisted, turned it upside down
Just a fool to hang around

So they call me a fool
Call me a fool for your love baby
And I’ll be a fool any time

Box of air
A dusty square
Pins the sun to the voids
Empty frames and cloudy pains
Lonely chair against the wall

As we lay between the embers we were bathed in light
I was magnetized (Hold down a scar)
By the way you turn your face, you catch the sun aside
I was just behind (Hold down, stop)

Where we were, and who we are
In the cold and plain and twilight of your heavy mind
I was crystalized (Hold down a scar)
As I watched away the fingerprints we left behind
I lay down and cry (Hold down, stop)

She bargains with the world
So everything she wants will come to her
With no greed inside her mind
She knows what she deserves
We fell from sky with grace
And landed in her soft and warm embrace
She gave her love, her gift of life
So we could live with her

That is why we live like heathens
Stealing from the trees of Eden
Living in the arms of freedom
And everything we touch is evil
That is why we live like heathens

The stone, the dirt, the dust
The unforgiving promise made to us
Unworthy of your light, your god, your touch
We're guided by the lust
We cry the fallen names
We cry for those you burned beneath the flame
We stand beside the good and brave
The broken and enslaved

That is why we live like heathens
Stealing from the trees of Eden
Living in the arms of freedom
And everything we touch is evil
That is why we live like heathens

Everything you touch will be hers
A mother with no heart will give love
Her love is yours, but only if you give your heart to her

That is why we live like heathens
Stealing from the trees of Eden
Living in the arms of freedom
And everything we touch is evil
That is why we live like heathens

But then they sit around and wallow in their pain
And I am the same
I let it crawl into my sick bed
I let it bleed on the silk threads
I thought that was what you wanted
Now I'm praying for a quick death
And she's saying
She's got the only thing around that's gonna sort it
The only trouble is I could never afford it
And ain't that a shame

And ain’t that a shame

There’s only so many things I can do to ignore it
When at the end of the day it's written on my forehead
Why I'm this way

You'll never get love by force
The truth will always take its course
Some people really have no shame
It's just an illness with a name

We were having too much fun
Drinking coffees in the sun
Someone wanted to be king
Came and fucked up everything

Goodbye my dictator, goodbye
Cause everybody knows it's time
You've had more than your share of pie
Goodbye my dictator, goodbye

It's hard for most to understand
That good intentions not all havе
Why must we always stand on guard
When therе is love and there is art

We were having too much fun
Drinking coffees in the sun
Yesterday life was divine
But now we're going back in time

So goodbye my dictator, goodbye
Cause everybody knows it's time
You've had more than your share of pie
Goodbye my tormentor, goodbye
Goodbye my dictator, goodbye
Cause everybody's sick and tired
We'll all be dancing when you die
Goodbye my dictator, goodbye

Goodbye my dictator, goodbye

Poor Johnny's heart
Went pitty-pitty-pat
Somewhere in sunny France
He met a girl by chance
With a naughty, naughty glance
She looked just like a kitty, kitty cat
She loved to dance and play
Though he learned no French
When he left the trench
He knew well enough to say
He knew well enough to say

Oui, oui, Marie
Will you do this for me?
Oui, oui, Marie
And I'll do that for you
I love your eyes, they make me feel so swoony
You drive me loony
You're teasing me

Why can't we parlez-vous
Like other sweethearts do?
I want a kiss or two
From ma chérie
Oui, oui, Marie
If you do this for me
Oui, oui, Marie
Then I'll do that for you

They walked along the boule-boulevard
He whispered, ""You for me""
""Some day in gay Paris""
""I will make you marry me""
Just then, a bunch of bully, bully boys
Threw kisses on the sly
But Marie got wise when they rolled their eyes
They sing as they passed her by
They sing as they passed her by

Oui, oui, Marie
Will you do this for me?
Oui, oui, Marie
And I'll do that for you
I love your eyes, they make me feel so swoony
You drive me loony
You're teasing me
You drive me loony

As I lay next to him

For just that mistake
Your ghost was calling
I was just beyond the break

To pry open the door

To take me on the floor
To ask a ghost for more

The glorious will always
Be just around the bend
But I can't ask to borrow

It's sixty-six and cloudy this mornin’
I'll make a bet those clouds will turn to rain
The weather's rusted out the sign
And I almost missed the turn
That’ll take me down to Saunders Ferry Lane

The creekin' boards of the empty dock
Are the only sounds I hear
The sign on the catfish stand says, ""Closed 'til spring""
The summer drown in the frozen lake
As the winter came to life

And nothing moves in Saunders Ferry Lane
Nothing moves in Saunders Ferry Lane

Raindrops mingle with the leaves
That tumble to the ground
As I find my way to the spot
Where we once lay
But the grass is dead
The laughter's gone
And the birds have flown away

It's awful cold in Saunders Ferry Lane
Awful cold in Saunders Ferry Lane

The gentle arms that held me
And made me want tomorrow, now are gone
We found so much comfort
In the way we loved each other
Then the angels came
As quietly as the dawn

Standing by the water
In the icy winter wind
I find no present comfort for my pain
No gentle arms to hold me now
I know there's nothin' worse

Your blue eyes still aren't dry
Your hands have run through your blonde hair a thousand times
You say you're going to Samarra
Won't be back tomorrow
You left a letter on the drawer
Bread winners won't be baking anymore
I've been wondering for awhile
How records in your heart
Pull the Brompton shakes apart
The blood is in your hands
The bodies on the ground around us
Make no future plans
Sever every bound that binds us
That ties us
There is blood on the clothes that you'd once wear for him
Was it worth the lace facade
His hands you still feel round your waist on rainy days
I've been wondering for awhile
How records from your past
Make the brief encounters last

The blood is on your hands
The bodies on the ground around us
Make no future plans
Sever every bound that binds us
The blood is on your hands
The bodies on the ground around us
Make no future plans
Sever every bound that binds us

Make no future plans

My old friend, these poems that you preach
They're being wasted as you speak
Remind me once more how they came to be your calling
Do you even know you're falling?

You know that for you I'd give an arm
I'm one of few that never meant you harm
And I heed you like I heed fire and thunder
But from time to time I wander
And lately I did wonder

If you did it all to make you feel desired
Did it all to make you feel admired
For love to replace your shamе

That's quite the group that you have gathеred now
Most of them, they just want you somehow
They would pay any price to kiss your skin
Don't tell me that is loving
You know that don't mean nothing

You know
You must know
And yet you give it all to make you feel desired
Give it all to make you feel admired
For love to replace your shame
You give it all to make you feel desired
Give it all to make you feel admired
For love to replace your shame
For love to replace your shame
For us to praise your name

Now, my friend, I won't forget
The darkness blinding me before we met
It's all I need to remember you
As the light you were
Even though for sure
You won't remember me
No, you won't remember me, hmm

I'm afraid that no amount of fame
Will ever wash away the shame
Of knowing not how to love your only friend
Who will love you till the end"

J'suis pas d'humeur, j'ai mal dormi, j'vais m'faire un verre
J'ai pas d'amour, j'ai pas d'amis donc pas d'emmerdes
Pas d'paradis, pas d'utopie, j'ai pas d'enfer, moi

J'crois plus en Dieu depuis que lui n'croit plus en moi
J'crois plus en toi, t'as dit : ""Je t'aime"", tu l'pensais pas
Cerveau surchauffe, pourquoi ma tête est faite comme ça ?
Mon corps t'a menti, j'ai pas kiffé tant que ça
J'fais c'que j'veux, j'm'en fous d'l'heure qu'il est
J'pleure dans l'micro, j'gagne des milliers

J'mène des actions, souvent j'trébuche, j'suis compliquée
Armure en béton, pas d'embûches, j'fais que briller
Un jour, j'vais m'calmer pour laisser quelqu'un m'aimer
Oui, j'checke mes likes mais juste pour voir si t'as liké
Toutes mes névroses me portent bonheur
J'en fais d'la prose, j'en fais du beurre
Tout c'qui m'tue pas, c'est full bonus
J'kiffe les yeux noirs, j'trouve qu'ils brillent plus
Paris s'visite en noctilien, mais tu feras tes stories demain

Father, don't blame us for trying to live
For trying to love, for wanting more
Father, don't blame us for trying to bleed
Like real human beings and nothing more

Why did you dress our pleasure up as greed?
While you're limiting our love, taking sunlight from the seed?
Why did you give us hearts we don't understand
Like an apple in our hand that you'll never let us have?

And I hear you don't like it
I don't care if you don't

Father, don't blame us for trying to live
For trying to love, for wanting more
Father, don't blame us for trying to bleed
Like real human beings and nothing more

Oh, do you еnvy how I'm free?
How the life in me is rеal, running barefoot through the fields?
Oh, does it hurt how I don't look at you with fear?
Do you like to watch me kneel, 'cause the way it makes you feel?

And I hear you don't like it
I don't care if you don't

Father, don't blame us for trying to live
For trying to love, for wanting more

But you cannot burn the witch away"

I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on Survivor just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?

All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself, ""It's fine, you're just in love""

Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade

Now all of my friends are missing again
'Cause that's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
And you tell yourself, ""It's fine, you're just in love""

And I don't get along with anyone

Maybe I'm the problem

So, bow your heads
In the absence of bombs
Draw your breath

Dark, dark places shall be none
She's melting houses of gold
And the kids cry out:

We're spitting off the edge of the world
Out in the night
Never had no chance
Nowhere to hide
Spitting off the edge of the world
Out comes the sun
Never had no chance
Nowhere to run

Mama, what have you done?
I trace your steps
In the darkness of one
Am I what's left?
Silver lines whisper to me
Wounded arms must carry the load
And the kids cry out:

We're spitting off the edge of the world
Out in the night
Never had no chance
Nowhere to hide
We're spitting off the edge of the world
Nowhere to run
Never had no chance
Out comes the sun
Spitting off the edge of the world
Winds from the sky
Never had no chance
Will watch us rise"

And if we're cuttin free what are we gonna be

Every time that they hurt me I strayed from myself
Walked away from love, went straight for the dark
But the dark didn't suit me, it clashed with my heart

Frag' mich, warum immer Krieg ist, wenn du hier bei mir bist
Deine Worte Messer, es wär besser, wenn du gehst
Die Beretta matt-schwarz, verfehlst mein Herz nur haarscharf
Doch wenn du mich nur quälst, sag mir, warum du mir fehlst?

Schlägst die Faust auf den Tisch und ich glaub', du triffst mich
Ist es das, was du willst? Macht dich das happy?
Und es tut so krass weh, warum will ich dann noch nicht gehen?
Brauch' ich das Drama und die Trän'n? Macht mich das happy?

Und ich sag' nie mehr: „Für immer“, du warst mein „Für immer“
Mein „Für immer“ geht jetzt grad vorbei

Frag' mich, warum immеr Krieg ist, wenn du hier bеi mir bist
Deine Worte Messer, es wär besser, wenn du gehst
Die Beretta matt-schwarz, verfehlst mein Herz nur haarscharf
Doch wenn du mich nur quälst, sag mir, warum du mir fehlst?

Bang-bang, wer schießt zuerst?
Bang-bang, du zielst aufs Herz
Bang-bang, ich weiß, es trifft mich hart
Bang-bang, du schießt zuerst
Bang-bang, mein Lieblingsschmerz
Bang-bang, mein Blick wird langsam schwarz

Warum schweigst du mich an? Schrei mich an, so laut du kannst
Setz das Bett hier doch in Brand, ich muss was fühl'n
Ist das hier der Moment, in dem all das stirbt, was man kennt?
Alles, was man Liebe nennt, kann nichts mehr fühl'n

Und ich sag' nie mehr: „Für immer“, du warst mein „Für immer“
Mein „Für immer“ geht jetzt grad vorbei

Frag mich, warum immer Krieg ist, wenn du hier bei mir bist
Deine Worte Messer, es wär besser, wenn du gehst
Die Beretta matt-schwarz, verfehlst mein Herz nur haarscharf
Doch wenn du mich nur quälst, sag mir, warum du mir fehlst?

Said that it's fine, you learned how to lie
The next day was better, he just lost his temper
And all that's left now are the scars

Pas de paradis pas d’utopie j’ai pas d’enfer moi
Quand je mourrai quand tout sera fini je ferai pas de manières

Je crois plus en toi t’as dit “je t’aime” tu le pensais pas
Cerveau surchauffe pourquoi ma tête est faite comme ça ?
Mon corps t’a menti j’ai pas kiffé tant que ça
Je fais ce que je veux je m’en fous de l’heure qu’il est

Je mène des actions souvent je trébuche je suis compliquée
Armure en béton pas d'embûches je fais que briller
Un jour je vais me calmer pour laisser quelqu’un m’aimer
Oui je checke mes likes mais juste pour voir si t’as liké
Toutes mes névroses me portent bonheur
J’en fais de la prose j’en fais du beurre
Tout ce qui me tue pas c’est full bonus
Je kiffe les yeux noirs je trouve qu’ils brillent plus

Mais tu feras tes stories demain

I don't want you to see me cry
As God as my witness each time you kissed me
I was in paradise
Darling close your mouth
'Cause I don't like the way it sounds

Words that would kill me
If they were said out loud
I count the days
I won't make that same mistake
You vanish without a trace
'Cause I am the one betrayed

Bang bang

But now I'm the one

Like you used to down on your knees
You do as you told
Wearing your blindfold
Here on the rubber sheet
Baby, don't be scared
You're all tied up and going nowhere
So take a moment
Savour the moment
En realise how much I care
And one by one
I load up my silver gun
The time's come to get it done
So baby, let's have some fun

Split my head open, I see myself, I always jump the gun
Now I am dying at my own hands
I've done this before, never do it again
Life is delicious when you eat your own sins
I contemplate them and things starts to make sense
Change can be good, and I always forget
Forgot to change, and I broke my own neck
Are you really alive? Are you scared of your death?
Do you get high when you feel my cold breathe?

I never sought to love you
Never thought you would love me
So I was wrong about me loving you
And right about you loving me

Ships, they will break from their moorings
Vessels will float out to sea
Way on the drift, there goes my skiff
It's left me to float along the lea

Trees, they will shake loose their branches
Prairies, they shock into flame
Though it’s on land, change must be planned for
It's loneliness that never stays the same

I never sought to love you
Never thought you would love me
So I was wrong about me loving you
And right about you loving me"

When I was young, I tried to build a paper plane
But my head told me ""no""

That I had some time to grow
But I stayed up all night until I got it right and in the morning
I screamed, ""Hey, look! I made it!""
When I was young, I tried to build a paper plane
But my head told me ""no""

But I knew I was special
And when I didn't believe
I'd remember the moments when my family's waiting for me
And if I had a dollar
From the ones that didn't believе
I could sail away and live my life at sea

Yeah, yeah, 'cause I made it

Oh, oh, I made it

Sometimes I think about why we do what we do when
The world tell us ""no""
These walls were made to break and I'm breaking through
At times it's hard to show
And even though I'm scared, I know that I'm aware
That I'm exactly where I'm meant to be
So when I think about why I do what I do
It's everything to me

And I knew I was special
And when I didn't believe
I'd remember the moments when my family's waiting for me

And anyway, I'll pretend not to hear
Until you whisper it in my ear

Soft kiss, my baby wanted it
I could sense it from a mile away
He wants a bit of this sweet melancholy and
He can get it any time of day

'Cause nothing else can satisfy him
Oh, oh, I can't help myself
Something comes over me
Baby, whenever you are around

Light dims as he walks my way
I've been running for a reason I could never retain
Sweet lips like pink lemonade
When he's feeling generous he's gonna give me a taste

'Cause nothing else can satisfy me
Oh, oh, I can't help myself
Something comes over me
Baby, whenever you are around

Oh, oh, I can't help myself
Something comes over me
Baby, whenever you are around
Oh, oh, I can't help myself
Something grabs hold of me
Baby, whenever you are around"

J'ai écrit des tas de textes qui parlaient de nous

Ne sois pas déçu·e, tu vois, je peux t'aimer sans souffrir

Et n'en doute pas, je n'ai pas retrouvé ce cœur
Celui qui valsait le soir pour t'appeler âme sœur
Souviens-toi, la vie, cette chienne ne nous faisait pas peur
Aujourd'hui je vis parce que j'accepte la doulеur
C'était ma faute, au fond, d'être si jeunе
De croire que l'autre ne le vit pas comme un deuil

Pardon, pardon, j'n'ai pas assumé ton bonheur

J'n'ai pas assumé ton bonheur

J'ai volé si haut avant d'm'allonger sur le sol
J'pense que toi aussi, le temps a bridé ton envol
T'étais juste celle qui ne hurle pas par la parole
Moi, j'étais la brute qui t'en veux même quand tu m'consoles
J'ai tout tenté pour inventer un nouveau nous
Je te mentais, je ne cherchais que ce mois d'août
Resté tatoué au vent qui nous giflait les joues

Whеn your world begins to distort
When your own reflеction wants to take a walk

When you're not so sure of a choice
You were frozen yet even the  cry out

Make them see what they wanted and even you could be a hero
What are you doing when your  points up
Are you waiting for love to appear

What are you doing when it don't show up
Will you take your hope and go home
Or will you find it hidden in your monkey brain

You're barely a woman, and they call you a whore
Say that you’re ruined, when you're past twenty four

But I'm a cold-hearted, uptight bitch when I keep it inside

I'm just a baby, ah
But they try to slut shame me, ah
It's your fault I'm crazy
Yeah, that's what you made me
Say my looks can kill, this time they will

It might be a man's world

But I'll watch it burn
Hell is a teenage girl

Will you still think I'm pretty, when I come back to bite?
When I'm screaming like a siren in the middle of the night?
When I unleash thе storm just 'cause I'm bored?
If you're not scarеd of me, then what's this prison for?

And now I choke on every move I make
Let one play
To be that careless

With every kiss from a friend
With everything I pretend not to feel
Am I too high? Am I too proud?
Is the music too loud… for me to hear?

Now I go out
But every beat is a violent noise
Try as I might
With every beat comes a violent noise
The melody's sung
And I don't know the voice
Now I go out
But every beat is a violent noise

You've been staying out late
Trying your best to escape
I hope you find what you're looking for
Let a moment take place
Without running away
I hope you silence the noise

How could eyes this wide
Lose sight of a world outside?
I've looked away, cowardice
With every kiss from a friend
With everything I pretend not to feel
Am I too high? Am I too proud?
Is the music too loud… for me to hear?

Moving statues in the park
Mosaic faces fading in the rain
Recalling memories of loss
Yet untouched and unscatched

Is this really a mystery life?
Where we only learn from our own mistakes
Misstep, fall down stairs
Maybe you're too wise for me
Your quiet eyes break my heart now
You’re calling out, you're calling out
Despite it

A long car drive, music in air
Comes from a place out of nowhere
Staring at stars or a lightning bug
On a faraway stair, on a torch lit night
The field of depth on those marble steps
We'll meet again in light

That’s how it's done
That's how it's done
And how it's undone
That's how it starts
That's how it starts
And how it's unknown
Fall, fall
Calling out in spite of it all
Fall, fall
Will we meet again in the light?"

Trouble in little town
People all gathered 'round
Abandoned bag on a step
This is what happened next

I was only trying to hear what the teacher said
Then I heard a gunshot ringing in my head
Can see it on the evening news, there's twenty-three dead
In two-by-twos with our shirts stained red

We walk these streets of Heaven
We walk these streets of Heaven now

It's hard to get through the days
Knowing they're milеs away
Knowing what could've been
I look on down and I see

My brother on the stand, trying to makе a case
My mother in the hallway, with tears upon her face
The lawyers say these cruel machines, they keep us safe
But you and me, we know the price to pay

As we walk these streets of Heaven
Walk these streets of Heaven
It's to we walk these streets of Heaven

Another shot, wasted life
Another friend to walk beside
I know it hurts, but wipe your eyes
And we'll sing until the old men cry
It's just the way it is, I don't know why
It's just the way it is, I don't know why
It's just the way it is, I don't know why
We're just a bunch of kids, we didn't have to die

At last, when all of the world is asleep
You take in the blackness of air
The likes of a darkness so deep
That God, at the start, couldn't bear

And sit unseen with only the inner upheld
Your reflection can't offer a word
To the bliss of not knowing yourself
With all mirroring gone from the world

But, still, the mind, rejecting this new empty space
Fills it with something or someone
No closer could I be to God
Or why he would do what he's done

Crazy in love, daisy in bloom
Black hearts for pupils, I'm pacing the room
And I cover myself in tattoos of us
And dream of the day we еmbrace and combust

All this love, I'm so choked up
I can feel you in my blood
All this lust for just onе touch
I'm so scared to give you up

Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads, take mе home
To the place I bеlong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me
Radio reminds me of a home far away
Driving down the road, I get a feeling that I
Should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home
To the place that I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Take me home down country roads
Take me home down country roads"

When she was home
She was a swan
When she was out she was a tiger
And a tiger in the wild is not tied to anyone
When she was lost
She was a toad
The day I found her on the road
I gave her water and a rose
And as she stretched
The sun rose

Go, go, go
Go away, go away, go away
Go, go, go
Go away, go away

When she was young
She was a cow
And all day long
She milked the stars
She taught me
""Women to survive
Must be unfaithful to their child""
Of all the wonders of the world
She was a lady with a bird
She must have had so many lives
Was it the first?
Was it the last?

Go, go, go
Go away, go away, go away
Go, go, go
Go away, go away

When she was ill
She was a whale
She was so patient, she would wait
Until I sang her by the lane
The sweetest tunes to ease her pain
When she was old
She was an owl
I saw her swaying in the sky
And when she died inside my arms
I realised she was a cat

Go, go, go
Go away, go away, go away
Go, go, go
Go away, go away

Sometimes I wonder (go)
If my child (go)
Will have her eyes (go)
(Go away, go away)
To see through me (go)

And when I die (go)
And I am born again (go)
(Go away, go away)
What will I be (go)
A stone? (go)
A cat? (go)
A tree? (Go away, go away)

Go, go, go
Go away, go away, go away
Go, go, go
Go away, go away, go away

Go, go, go
Go away, go away, go away
Go, go, go
Go away, go away, go away

Go, go, go
Go away, go away"

They shut the gates about an hour after dark
We could walk there, we can laugh
Ain't it funny how owners look like their dogs?

Oh, I'll claw back my confidence
You'll say, ""Do you think we can be friends?""

Oh, maybe we have reached The End

Do you remember when Taylor Hawkins died?
Did you see his son playin' the drums live?
It made me sad, did it make you cry?

Et je conduis bourrée, non faut pas le faire mais
J'ai bien essayé tu me tiens par derrière
Et je sens ton odeur de parfum et de vodka
Je sais que c'est la peur qui te retient à moi

Oui j'ai tout gâché encore une fois
Dans mon téléphone t'as fouillé non fallait pas
Et j'ai frappé les murs j'ai cassé la porte
Je te balance des injures quand la colère m'emporte
Et maintenant j'ai que mes yeux qui pleurent pour deux
Quand je m'en veux (Quand je m'en veux)

Mon WhatsApp sur écoute j'ai grillé toutes mes chances
T'en n'as plus rien à foutre ça c'est ce que tu me balances
Balances moi tes plus belles insultes
J'ai pas peur du hardcore
Tu peux me traiter de pute moi je peux encaisser encore
Bébé j'accélère Paris est flou
Pourquoi je fais tout pour te perdre ?
Pourquoi je sabote tout ?
Et j'ai le cœur qui se serre si tu veux plus rien du tout

Est-ce qu'on a rien trouvé de mieux pour panser la plaie ?
Est-ce mes 20 ans qui réveillent tous ces non-dits ?
Est-ce mes parents qui vieillissent sans rien me dire ? Bah ouais
Est-ce qu'on finit par accepter qu'on subit ?
Est-ce que ce gars comprendra qu'il m'a sali ?
Est-ce que le bonheur nous a glissé des mains ?
Est-ce qu'on en parle pour ne pas penser à demain ?

C'est notre art qui m’a donné ce corps
Un million de petits chocs dans la poitrine c'est ça le score
Tu sais, on est pas si mal dans nos peaux
Juste malades mentaux

J'les veux pas, les réponses
Car je pense que rien ne s’explique
J'ai fait le puzzle et c'est peut-être con mais je choisis la musique
Je veux qu'on hurle, qu'on rassemble toutes les pièces
Ma génération a du sens, face au monde elle a choisi d’être honnête
Est-ce qu'il existe un futur un peu plus juste ?
Est-ce que mon frère saura brûler les insultes ?
Est-ce qu'on se relève toujours après la chute ?
Est-ce que j'ai l'énergie qu'il faut pour la lutte ?
Est-ce normal de toujours tout ramener à moi ?
Est-ce que les cons cesseront de nous faire du mal ?
Est-ce qu'on peut laisser les gens s'aimer sans lois ?
Est-ce qu'on peut laisser les gens ?
Est-ce que mon discours nous sert à quelque chose ?

And all the ways you need me are from God
And all the ways you reach him are flawed

Lie to me and say you'll never leave
Drown me in your twisted melodies
I'll pretend you wrote 'em all for me

I know I'd give my soul to fix my mistakes
But I wanna be the one that you call when there's something wrong

Greed and sorrow
Go to the abyss in time

Seas are on fire
And the moon’s falling down
So I’m playing my lyre
In the last rays of sun

Be mine when the world ends
And skies tumble down
Why is the water so soothing
To drown?
Hug me tight
You’re lighter than feather
This second of life
Feels like forever

When truth sounds like lying
When you and I
Are buried in the ruins of Earth
I’ll be by your side for what it’s worth
If we face the gates of Hell

Seas are on firе
And the moon’s fallen down
So I’m playing the lyrе
In the last rays of sun

Be mine when the world ends
And skies tumble down
Why is the water so soothing

Feels like forever

This world had failed us all
Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn
So let it burn"

So I really hope this finds you well

Different natures, different nights

When all our plans have gone to hell
And you're not here for me to tell

But it's all good until we're lonely with our love

Seems so ordinary, but you mistake
I was very, very different that day
I could tell you liked the way that I changed, not myself
But it was such a good day the way you held me
And I whispered your name, you whispered mine the same
And held me into your gaze, into your silence

Every day, wanna be close to him and never leave
Every day, not the same as the way it used to be
No, I won't change, I won't change, somеthing's coming over me
But you say what you say
Every day, you tеll me it's wrong, you tell me it's wrong
You tell me it's wrong, you tell me it's wrong

I think you could let me back into your life
Push me back out, well, I really have tried
And I can't think about the way it feels right with your hands on me
And in the back of my mind, everybody wants to be me sometimes
Everybody wants to hold you so tight
And I might die if I don't have you this time, have you this life

Every day, wanna be close to him and never leave
Every day, not the same as the way it used to be
No, I won't change, no, I won't change, something's coming over me
Pull the face, pull the face
Pull the face and tell me it's wrong, you tell me it's wrong
You tell me it's wrong, you tell me it's wrong

Sometimes, I touch myself
Just can't seem to get the help you left behind me
In the back of my mind, I suffer the pain
And it was over again, all for a game
Turn the other way, said you won't change, said you won't go away
What did you say, what did you say, what did you say to me?
Just the other day, said it won't change, said it won't go away
Feelings don't change, what did you say, what did you say to me?

I awoke early this morning only to find
No space in my heart, even less in my mind
The smell on the ground outside just seemed to scream
Of everywhere we'd been, everything that we'd seen

Here in the snow, where I first let you go
It plagues my heart, how it all fell apart
I always thought, we would be, tapestry
Together entwined, now this dream, it has died

Every instance I mistook your shape asleep
It's likе I'm stumbling out of myself and into a scene
Thеre's a plummeting weight that I can hardly explain
It's more than I can take, more than I can contain

Here in the snow, where I first let you go
It plagues my heart, how it all fell apart
I always thought, we would be, tapestry
Together entwined, now this dream, it has died"

Kept outside these city walls
The tiger sang to me
From the wreckage of eternity
To his Caspian Sea
To fight is holy, but to starve is free
I am misery
For one moment in this hellish ring
I lock your eyes and see

You're also dying
You're also safe
You're also dying
You're also safe

You're awful shiny
And I'm awful vague
You're so together
And I'm known to beg
For one moment won't you lie with me
I'm in the rain
For one moment it's the last I swear
I feel your pain

You're also dying
You'rе also safe
You're also dying
You're also safе
You're also dying
You're also safe
You're also dying
You're also safe
You're also dying
You're also safe

Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

Ten years the waves rolled the ships home from the sea
Thinking well how it may blow in all good company
If I tell another what your own lips told to mе
Let me lay 'neath thе roses, let my eyes no longer see

I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

One pane of glass in the window
No one is complaining though
Come in and shut the door
Faded is the crimson from the ribbons that she wore
And it's strange how no one comes 'round anymore

I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there


I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there"

Ungelebte Träume, an den Wänden meiner Wohnung
Ich schau' sie an mit Reue, und ich häng' sie auf wie Fotos
Und da draußen ist 'ne Welt, die hat nichts mit mir zu tun
Und alles schwankt und fällt, das Haus in dem ich bin, ah

Und ich bin dem Himmel nah
Doch bleib' den Sternen fern
Kein Glück, kein bisschen da, ah
Marlboro, Freiheit auf der Zunge
Rauch in der Lunge
Puste aus in die blaue Nacht
Im achtzehnten Stock ist es dunkel
Vеrläuft sich ein Funke Glück hierhin hеut Nacht?

Die Stadt ist geschmolzen, pure Sonne, keine Wolken
Jetzt hab' ich was ich wollte, und dich dabei verlorn'

Und ich bin dem Himmel nah
Doch bleib' den Sternen fern
Kein Glück, kein bisschen da, ah
Marlboro, Freiheit auf der Zunge
Rauch in der Lunge
Puste aus in die blaue Nacht
Im achtzehnten Stock ist es dunkel
Verläuft sich ein Funke Glück hierhin heut Nacht?

Jetzt wird's gefährlich, denn langsam merk' ich
Dass ich viel mehr will, Träume auf Scherben
Ein Schritt nach vorn, und gleich wieder zurück
Zwischen Asphalt und Beton, find ich vielleicht mein Glück

Und ich bin dem Himmel nah
Doch bleib' den Sternen fern
Kein bisschen Glück ist da, mh"

There's a new wave coming over me
Floating down from the stairs into my arms
It wraps me in a charm

I'm dizzy and I'm cursed
To never let you go
You're breaking my heart
I love you for it though

Barely there
You could walk right through me
God, I swear
I'll be good if you let me stick around
Don't let me fade away

To never let you go
You're breaking my heart

You got your tongue-twisted fantasy wrong
Is she sleeping when you call me?
In a second, I'm coming for you

That's the way

The blood in your veins (Blood in your veins)
Must be colored gold (Must be colored gold)
I take your pain (Yes, I'll take you pain)
And you give me a dead rose (And I still got hope)
I won't run away
The beauty's engraved
And it is something that is lost
And if you wanna stay
You'd lose your way
That's the way it goes

Lover, I cuss in your name
So much my breath smells like you
Lately the sky it'd be blue and steady raining
You got the angels crying over you

Through your pretty eyes
I look at the world, it's so pretty
Do you look at me with pity
Or do you realize
But it's all picture perfect
And I still don't seem worth it
And I still don't seem worth it
But I'm still not enough
But I still won't give up
I want you to stay stoned in love
You know I stay stoned
'Cause I say more
And my brains don't respond
Oh, I'll be dark so she glows

The breath of earth calls to me
