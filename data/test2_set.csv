Lazy yellow moon comin' up tonight
Shinin' through the trees
Crickets are singin' and lightnin' bugs
Are floatin' on the breeze
Baby get ready

Across the field where the crick turns back
By the old stone road
I'm gonna take you to a special place
That nobody knows
Baby get ready
Ooh, ooh

You and me goin' fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
Stayin' the whole night through
Feels so good to be with you

Spring is almost over and the summer's comin'
The days are gettin' long
Waited all winter for the time to be right
Just to take you along
Baby get ready

And it don't matter if we sit forever
And the fish don't bite
Jump in the river and cool ourselves
From the heat of the night
Baby get ready
Ooh, ooh

You and me goin' fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
Stayin' the whole night through
It feels so good to be with

You and me goin' fishin' in the dark
(You and me goin' fishin' in the dark)
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
(Down by the river in the full moonlight)
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
(We'll be fallin' in love)

I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright

Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

It's been fifteen years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

Now I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doing alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

Sometimes it's lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm falling, desperately calling
Howlin' at the moon ah-ooh


Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a Fu-Manchu

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good"

Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh

And the days go by like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own, I begin again
Said to my friend, baby (Everything stops)
Nothin' else mattered
He was no more (He was no more)
Than a baby then
Well, he seemed broken-hearted
Somethin' within him
But the moment that I first laid eyes on him
All alone on the edge of seventeen

Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Said, ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh

Well, I went today
Maybe I will go again tomorrow
Yeah, yeah
Well, the music there
Well, it was hauntingly familiar
When I see you doin'
What I try to do for me
With the words of a poet
And a voice from a choir
And a melody
And nothin' else mattered

Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Said, ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh

The clouds never expect it when it rains
But the sea changes color
But the sea does not change
So with the slow graceful flow of age
I went forth with an age-old desire to please
On the edge of seventeen, ooh, ah

Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh

Well, then suddenly
There was no one left standin' in the hall
Yeah, yeah
In a flood of tears
That no one really ever heard fall at all
When I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
And not to find an answer, just to hear the call
Of a nightbird singin', come away (Come away, come away)

Just like the white-winged dove sings a song (Just like the white-winged dove)
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh

Well, I hear you (Well, I hear you)
In the morning (In the morning)
And I hear you (And I hear you)
At nightfall (At nightfall)
Sometimes to be near you
Is to be unable to hear you, my love
I'm a few years older than you, my love (I'm a few years older than you)

Just like the white-winged dove sings a song (Just like the white-winged dove)
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'

Hey, where did we go?
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughin' and a-runnin', hey, hey
Skippin' and a jumpin'
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a thumpin'

And you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall

With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-tee-da?
Just like that
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-tee-da

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium

With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing

Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight, you look so pretty
Yes, you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me, what you do to me

Hey there, Delilah, I know times are gettin' hard
But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes, and trains, and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there, Delilah, you be good, and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school, and I'll be making history
Like I do

Now, that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey-hey
Since the return of her stay on the Moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey-hey
Hey-hey, yeah

But tell me, did you sail across the Sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Now, that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracin' her way through the constellation, hey-hey (Mmm)
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey-hey, yeah
Now, that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly, so he never did land

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet? (Feet)
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day (The light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?
And tell me, did you sail across the Sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

Na-na, na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day?

Been flyin' solo for so long
Nobody's singin' the harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No bass, no guitar, no tambourine

And I found you like a melody
You were singin' in the same key as me
We had ‘em dancin' in the streets

I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand

I wanna run down your wild dreams
And I wanna chase every high with you
Count every rip in these old jeans
We'll never learn how to sing the blues

If I'm gonna be famous

We got our own little groove

The chairs are all stacked, and there's no one around

With the world and those who lead it

So we keep waiting (Waiting)

To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting (Waiting)

We keep on waiting (Waiting)

We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting (Waiting)

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer

Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Mm, uh-huh

I was down at the New Amsterdam
Staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer
You know, she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful

So come dance this silence down through the morning
Sha-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah
Cut up, Maria
Show me some of them Spanish dances and
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
'Cause I wanna be someone who believes
Yeah

Mr. Jones and me
Tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at them beautiful women
She's looking at you
Oh no, no, she's looking at me
Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you
You can never be lonely

Well, I'm gon' paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red, and black, and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me
Look into the future
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's looking at you
I don't think so, she's looking at me
Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me
I will never be lonely

I will never be lonely
Said, I'm never gonna be lonely

I wanna be a lion
Yeah, everybody wanna pass as cats
We all wanna be big, big stars
Yeah, but we got different reasons for that
Believe in me
'Cause I don't believe in anything
And I, I wanna be someone to believe
To believe, to believe, yeah

Mr. Jones and me
Stumbling through the barrio
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's perfect for you
Man, there's got to be somebody for me
I wanna be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone
Just a little more funky
When everybody loves you
Oh son, that's just about as funky as you can be
Mr. Jones and me
Staring at the video
When I look at the television, I wanna see me
Staring right back at me
We all wanna be big stars
But we don't know why and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me
I wanna be just about as happy as I can be

Mr. Jones and me
We're gonna be big stars"

On such a timeless flight

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if ya did
And all the science, I don't understand

Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance, and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people, go

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget, no
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all, Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over

But this is gonna take me down

He's so bad, but he does it so well

Say you'll see me again

His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe

Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your

I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's gotta be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on, on

And suddenly
I've become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and it's effortless
Without a sound
We lose sight of the ground in the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down 'til we torch it ourselves

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Everyone knows
She's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head, I'm over my—

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind"

I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm bein' honest
Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better 'cause you don't want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothin' here without you

So, one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault, I should've been more careful

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothin' here without you, baby

Every morning when you come downstairs
Hair's a mess but I don't care
No makeup on and shining so bright
My old sweatshirt never fit so right
Dancing around to the radio
Humming the words that you don't know
Cross out finding an angel off my list
Thinking that it don't get no better than this

You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

Wrapped around me late at night
Pillow talk by candle light
Gonna slow this down and make it last
The best things fly by us so fast

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do

It's no secret that lately there ain't no escape
And that I've been waking up alone
Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling
That you ain't ever coming home
But today, the tears ain't gonna hit the floor
Cause the boat's in the bay and it's calling my name
So I'm heading on out the door

'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

When I turned the ignition I knew I'd been missing
The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened
Too busy taking all the blame
But a drink or two is a foolproof remedy
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kinda making eyes at me

'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

There'll be plenty of time for what ifs and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait

'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue

She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

A, amen
Amen, amen

I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny
Somethin' meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean

Oh, oh, amen
Amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

Old enough to get there, but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk

Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin' better

My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, oh

For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kinda nerve
Takin' all I want

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Where were you? Where were you?
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

Why'd you have to wait
To find me? To find me?"

Some things we don't talk about
Rather do without and just hold the smile
Falling in and out of love
Ashamed and proud of, together all the while

You can never say never
While we don't know when
But time and time again
Younger now than we were before

Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Picture, you're the queen of everything
Far as the eye can see under your command
I will be your guardian when all is crumbling
I'll steady your hand

You can never say never
While we don't know when
But time, time, and time again
Younger now than we were before

Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

We're pulling apart and coming together again and again
We're growing apart, but we pull it together
Pull it together, together again

Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn’t have to try
Let’s lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

But maybe we can leave with something out of all this hurt

Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now

Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now

Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

And will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?

Dreams; that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope; hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then, it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally, I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you (Not over you)

Damn, damn, girl, you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still, you're magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me (Old me)
But I'm not even close without you

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally, I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally, I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

Not over you (Not over you)
Not over you (Not over you)
Not over you (Not over you)"

You could be my new prescription

All you're giving me is friction
Hey, sugar, what you gotta say?

Live and learn from fools and from sages

All the things come back to you

Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try, but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world

Oh-oh, we got our feet on the ground

And we're caught up in the crossfire

Watching your dress as you turn down the light
I forget all about the storm outside
Dark clouds roll their way over town
Heartache and pain came a-pouring down
Like hail, sleet and rain, yeah
They're handing it out

And we're caught up in the crossfire

And we're searching for shelter
Lay your body down

Tell the devil that he can go back from where he came
His fiery arrows drew their bead in vain
And when the hardest part is over we'll be here
And our dreams will break the boundaries of our fears
Boundaries of our fears

It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind
The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind
So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
'Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again"

You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more

Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you ""no,"" but my body keeps on telling you ""yes""
Try to tell you ""stop,"" but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up, feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell

Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you (Making me love you)
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head

Oh baby, would you look right there
The way the sun is hitting your hair
The way the world just stopped right here
In mid-air, I don’t ever wanna move

You put the cool in the breeze
You put the weak here in the knees
You put me right where I’m supposed to be
In your blue-eyed sea
And I wanna sail away

'Cause when I wake up in the middle of the night
You’re holding me so tight

Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone

You knock me out kiss by kiss
I need you baby, sip by sip
Sit back and let me drink you in
I’m falling for you
Over and over and over again

When I wake up in the middle of the night
You’re holding me so tight

Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone

Everywhere I want to go and
Everywhere I want to be at
Everywhere I’ve ever been
Everything I’ll ever need
Is sitting right here next to me

Go ahead as you waste your days with thinking
When you fall, everyone stands
Another day and you've had your fill of sinking
With the life held in your

When all you gotta keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know ya do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
Move along

So a day when you've lost yourself completely
Could be a night when your life ends
Such a heart that will lead you to deceiving
All the pain held in your

Hands are shaking cold
Your hands are mine to hold
Speak to me

When all you gotta keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know ya do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along

(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
When everything is wrong, we move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
When everything is wrong, we move

Along (Along)

The one desire
Believe when I say

But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say

Am I your fire?
Your one desire
Yes, I know it's too late
But I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Now I can see that we've fallen apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance, I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

You are my fire
The one desire
You are (You are, you are, you are)
Don't wanna hear you say

Ain't nothin' but a heartache (Hey, yeah)
Ain't nothin' but a mistake (Don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (Oh, yeah)

In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, nigga, please don't touch (Don't touch)
And keep talkin' that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And, it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standin' in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was puttin' you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standin' in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you

I will have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)

So since I'm not your everything (Irreplaceable)
How about I'll be nothing (Nothing)
Nothing at all to you (Nothing)
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you (I won't shed a tear)

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

Do you remember
The twenty-first night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away, oh yeah

Hey, hey, hey

My thoughts are with you
Holdin' hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love, remember
How we knew love was here to stay
Now December
Found a love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love, remember
True love we share today

Hey, hey, hey (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space, mm
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much, mm

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice, mm
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them, mhm
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life

And don't ever look back, don't ever look back

Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back

Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)

We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)

Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu (Baby)
Next to you (Oh, oh)

We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning and you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start, a dream come true in Malibu"

Gotta fix that calendar I have

Head underwater and they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me, it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today
(Yeah) Today, yeah

I learned the hard way that they all say
Things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you
And your twisted words, your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry

Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today

Promise me
That you'll leave the light on
To help me see
With daylight, my guide, gone
'Cause I believe there's a way
You can love me because I say...

I won't write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (Ooh)
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this, huh
Is that why you wanted a love song? (Yeah)
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (Write you a love song)
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you (I want you) to stay
If your heart is nowhere in it, I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas (Walk the seven seas)

Saturday night I was downtown
Working for the FBI
Sittin' in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high
Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman sing a song
A pair of 45's made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
Just-a 5'9, beautiful, tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all

I saw her heading to the table
Like a tall walking big black cat
When Charlie said I hope that you're able, boy
Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at
Then suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
A-jumping out of doors and tables
When I heard somebody shootin' a gun

Well the DA was pumping my left hand
And a-she was a-holding my right
Well I told her don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared
I've gotta be forgiven if I wanna spend my living
With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9 beautiful tall
Yeah, with just one look I was a bad mess
Cause that long cool woman had it all
Had it all
Had it all"

Stranded in this spooky town
Stop lights are swaying and the phone lines are down
Floor is crackling cold
She took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun

Driven by the strangle of vein
Showing no mercy, I'd do it again
Open up your eyes
You keep on crying, baby, I'll bleed you dry
Skies, they blink at me
I see a storm bubbling up from the sea

And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer

You shimmy shook my boat
Leaving me stranded all in love on my own
Do you think of me?
Where am I now? Baby, where do I sleep?
Feels so good, but I'm old
Two thousand years of chasing taking it's toll

And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer

Taking to the floor with the reach to the sky
I loosen my tie, I loosen my tie
Locking down the door with the rhythm and rhyme
I loosen my tie, I loosen my tie

Trying to recall what you want me to say
I shake your way, I shake your way
Counting on the night for a beautiful day
I shake your way, I shake your way

And I say, you can't get enough
No, you can't get enough

Given a chance
I'm gonna be somebody
If for one dance
I'm gonna be somebody
Open the door
It's gonna make you love me
Facing the floor
I'm gonna be somebody

Now is your time and you know where you stand
With a gun in your hand, with a gun in your hand
Now I'm no longer an ordinary man
Was this your big plan? Your gun in your hand

And I say, you can't get enough
No, you can't get enough (Can't get enough)

You fault my pride
Don't ever need to 'pologize
As your lips unfold
Shaken purple from the cold

You better learn to crawl
You better learn to crawl
'Fore I walk away

You broke my mouth
The bloody bits are spitting out
Is your grave unscathed?
The worm is counting down the days

He wants to see you crawl
He wants to see you crawl
Before I walk away
'Fore I walk away

The reds and the whites and abused
The crucified USA
As every prophecy unfolds
Oh, Hell is truly on its way


As the rat and the fly
They're searching for an alibi
As we await the wrath
They never went to Sunday Mass

They want to see us crawl
They want to see us crawl
'Fore they walk away
Before they walk away

The reds and the whites and abused
The crucified USA
As every prophecy unfolds
Oh, Hell is truly on its way"

I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times, I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up, then I let myself down

I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I'd thought of every possibility

And I know some day that it’ll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life

And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby, your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility

And somehow, I know that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you, kid, I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

They say all’s fair in love and war
But I won’t need to fight it
We'll get it right and we'll be united

And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility

And someday, I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work to work it out
Promise you, kid, I'll give more than I get
Than I get, than I get, than I get

Oh, you know it'll all turn out

You twist to fit the mold that I am in

But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do (Life is hard)
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew

That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)

Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

(Yeah) Fingers trace your every outline (Oh yeah, yeah)

Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

É o seu garoto, Young

Geah! História em construção

Tá louca demais agora

Eu olho profundamente nos seus olhos (Eu...)
Eu toco em você mais e mais toda vez
Quando você sai, eu fico implorando pra você não ir
Chamo seu nome, duas, três vezes seguidas
É uma coisa tão engraçada pra eu tentar explicar
Como estou me sentindo, e o meu orgulho é o culpado (Yeah)
Porque eu sei que não entendo
Como o seu amor pode fazer o que ninguém mais pode

Me dеixou tão louca agora
Seu amor me deixou tão louca agora (Sеu amor)

Me deixou esperando um beep seu agora (Hey)
Seu beijo me deixou esperando que você me salvasse agora

Quando eu falo com as minhas amigas no quieto
(""Quem ele pensa que é?"") Olha o que você fez comigo
De tênis, nem preciso comprar um vestido novo
Se você não estiver aí, não tenho mais ninguém pra impressionar
É o jeito que você sabe o que eu pensei que sabia
É a batida que meu coração faz quando estou com você
Mas eu ainda não entendo
Como o seu amor pode fazer o que ninguém mais pode

Eu tô aquecido agora, vamo lá

Young Hov, vocês sabem quando o flow é louco
Young B e a R-O-C, uh-oh (Oh)
O.G. Big Homie, o primeiro e único (Oh, não)
Tô em forma, mas os bolsos são gordos igual o Tony (Oh, não)
Soprano, a ROC carrega igual o Van Exel
Eu balaço esses falsos, cara, você não pode chegar perto
O artigo genuíno, eu não canto
Eu atiro, se acontecer algo, eu te mato
Uma estrela igual o Ringo, guerra igual uma Boina Verde
Você é louco? Traga a sua tropa toda
O JAY-Z tá na Range, louco e perturbado
Eles não conseguem entendê-lo, eles estão tipo, ""Hey, ele é louco?"" (Oh, não)
Sim senhor, eu fui feito de um tecido diferente
Minha textura é o melhor casaco de pele: chinchila
Tenho estado mais foda do que os fumantes compulsivos
Como você acha que ganhei o nome Hova?
Tenho sido o mais real, o jogo acabou
Volte isso, Young
Desde que eu fiz a mudança pra platina
O jogo já tem um dono, faloupç

Me deixou, tão louca, meu amor
Eu não sou eu mesma ultimamente, sou tola, eu não faço isso
Eu estive brincando comigo mesma, baby, eu não me importo
Porque o seu amor tira o melhor de mim
E baby, você está me deixando boba
Você me pegou de jeito e eu não me importo com quem vê
Porque baby, você me pegou, você me deixou
Você me deixou, me deixou tão louca, baby
Hey!

Me deixou tão louca agora

I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart, oh

She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Woah, oh, oh

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But uh-oh

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Woah, oh, oh

And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright, oh-oh)

Into every inch of you
Because I know that's what you want me to do

And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears

What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt, and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt, and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning

Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)

Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself

Where is the love?

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the mornin', I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

While I'm wide awake, she's no trouble sleeping

And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're okay?

But no wise words gon' stop the bleeding

Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

My heart is paralyzed
My head was oversized
I'll take the high road like I should
You said it's meant to be
That it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are, I'm gonna say

She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are, I'm gonna say

She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

I wanna live a thousand lives with you

But you don't want to

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are, I'm gonna say
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are, I'm gonna say

She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies

She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died"

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everythin' that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

Da-da-da-da


I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

Play it again, oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"

My head is stuck in the clouds
She begs me to come down
Says, ""Boy, quit foolin' around""
I told her, ""I love the view from up here
Warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above
As it turns to the rhythm of love""

We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

My heart beats like a drum
A guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide
The moment her lips meet mine

We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears will dry
Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Da da da dum da da dum
Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba

And long after I've gone
You'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind
The way you make love so fine

We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

Oh, play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

When you said you needed space (What?)

""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""

But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

You called me up again tonight, but

You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?

To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)
But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams"

But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go?

Don't you blink; you might miss it
See, we got a right to just love it or leave it
You find it and keep it
'Cause it ain't every day you get the chance to say...

It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

But I found this love, I'm gonna feed it
You better believe
I'm gonna treat it better than anything I've ever had
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
Read it, it's signed and delivered, let's seal it
Boy, we go together like peanuts and Paydays

And everybody needs to get a chance to say...

Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart

Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

Everything is like a white out
'Cause we shika-shika shine down
Even when the, when the light's out, but I can see you glow
Got my head up in the rafters, got me happy ever after
Never felt this way before, ain't felt this way before

Comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're goin' to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibi
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside


I'm comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
(It was only a kiss) It was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's havin' a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're goin' to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibi
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside


I never
I never
I never

Step one, you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend (Where did I go wrong?)
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night (I would have stayed up)
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life"

You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey, baby, come on
I loved you endlessly
And you weren't there for me
So now, it's time to leave
And make it alone

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door

I just wanna tell you that I had enough
Might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie

You just hit me with the truth
Now, girl, you're more than welcome to
So, give me one good reason
Baby, come on

And now, I really come to see

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she living, she golden
She lives for me, says she lives for the ovation
Her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I'll make you smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give 'em the games she play, she say

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

The sky was gold, it was rose, I was taking sips of it to my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now, I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that filthy dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
Slides up around the belly face down on the mattress one
And you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself, head made of the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

And I want something else
To get me through this life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

The sky was gold, it was rose (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)
I was taking sips of it to my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)
In the place we used to sta-a-a-a-art

The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Was a beautiful day"

I don't need to be anything other

Than a birth of two souls in one

Part of where I'm going
Is knowing where I'm coming from

Anything other than what I've been tryna be lately
All I have to do is think of me, and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms
Wondering what I've gotta do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't wanna be anything other than me

I'm surrounded by liars
Everywhere I turn
I'm surrounded by imposters

I'm surrounded by identity crisis
Everywhere I turn

Am I the only one who noticed?
I can't be the only one who's learned

All I have to do is think of me, and I have peace of mind

Wondering what I've gotta do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't wanna be anything other than me, ah

Can I have everyone's attention please?
If you're not like this and that
You're gonna have to leave
I came from the mountain
The crust of creation
My whole situation made from clay to stone
And now I'm telling everybody

I don't wanna be

All I have to do is think of me, and I have peace of mind

Es wird dich befreien, wenn du mir einfach erzählst
Von jedem Geheimnis, ich werde zuhören

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

Yeah, it's over, it's over, I'm circling these vultures
Got me praying, man, this hunger, and feeling something rotten
Last time I saw you, said ""What's up?"" and pushed right through
Then I tried to catch you, but we're always on the move
And now it's over, we're sober, symptoms of the culture
And the night ain't getting younger, last call's around the corner
Feeling kinda tilted and I'm pouring out the truth
Just fading out these talkers 'cause now all I want is you
Just sayin'

Come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I'll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me, ooh-ooh-ooh

And I'll take you high
High, ooh-ooh-ooh

Well, I ain't frontin' my intention, got your man outlined in chalk
It's a midnight intervention, got no plans to make it stop
Last time I saw you, said you wanna keep it light
But I'm here to tell you I'm not trying to change your mind
It's all right, ooh-ooh-ooh
It's all right, ooh-ooh-ooh

Yeah, come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I'll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me, ooh-ooh-ooh

And I'll take you high
High

And I miss the rush of your skin
And I miss the still of the silence
As you breathe out and I breathe in

If I could walk on water
If I could tell you what's next
I'd make you believe
I'd make you forget

So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love
So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love

I miss the sound of your voice
The loudest thing in my head
And I ache to remember
All the violent, sweet
Perfect words that you said

If I could walk on water
If I could tell you what's next
I'd make you believe
I'd make you forget

So come on, get higher, loosen my lips

Just pull me down hard

I miss the pull of your heart
I taste the sparks on your tongue
I see angels and devils
And God, when you come on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

Because you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on

You had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
Ooh, a holiday

Sometimes, the system goes on the blink and the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know that you could be, well, oh, that strong
And I'm not wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

'Cause you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, you've seen what you're like
And how does it feel? One more time

Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades

You'll never know the murderer sitting next to you

But after all I've said, please don't forget

Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves

We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
You'll never know the freak show sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think ""How did I get here, sitting next to you?""

Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you (Look how they wave to you)
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (Yeah)

To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 45, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (One thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (Come on)

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

Become so tired, so much more aware

Ella toma mi dinero cuando estoy en necesidad
Sí, ella es una trivial amiga de hecho
Oh, ella es una cazafortunas
Que camina sobre la ciudad que cava en mí
(Uh)

(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres
(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres

(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante

Cutie la bomba, la conocí en un salón de belleza
Con un pequeño Louis Vuitton debajo del brazo
Ella dijo: ""Puedo decirte roca, puedo decirlo por tu encanto
Tan lejos como chicas, tienes un rebaño
Puedo decirlo por tu encanto y tu brazo""
Pero estoy buscando a la elegida, ¿La has visto?
Mi psíquica me dijo que tendría un culo como el de Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez; cuatro hijos
¿Y tengo que llevarme todos esos traseros malos a ShowBiz?
Okay, busca a tus hijos, pero luego ellos tienen a sus amigos
Paré en el Benz, todos se levantaron
Todos fuimos a cenar y luego tuve que pagar
Si estás follando con esta chica, será mejor que te paguen
¿Sabes por qué? Se necesita demasiado para tocarla
Por lo que escuché, ella consiguió un bebé de Busta
Mi mejor amiga dijo que solía follar con Usher
No me importa lo que ninguno de ustedes diga, todavía la amo

(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres
(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas

(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante

18 años, 18 años
Ella tiene a uno de tus hijos, te atrapó durante 18 años
Sé que alguien está pagando la manutención de los hijos de uno de sus hijos
El coche y la casa de su mamá son más grandes que ella
Lo verás en la televisión cualquier domingo
Gana el Super Bowl y conduce un Hyundai
Se suponía que iba a comprar tu pequeño Tyco con tu dinero
Ella fue al doctor, se hizo liposucción con tu dinero
Ella camina luciendo como Michael con tu dinero
Debería haberlo asegurado, Geico por tu dinero
Si no eres un punk
Mucho, ""¡Queremos prenupcial! ¡Queremos prenupcial!"" (¡Sí!)
Es algo que necesitas tener
Porque cuando te deje el culo, se irá con la mitad
18 años, 18 años
¿Y en el decimoctavo cumpleaños, descubrió que no era suyo?

(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres
(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres

(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante

Ahora, no estoy diciendo que seas un cazafortunas, tienes necesidades
No quieres que un tipo fume, pero no puede comprar marihuana
Salen a comer, no puede pagar, no pueden irse
Hay platos en la parte de atrás, tiene que arremangarse
Pero mientras todos ustedes lavan, mírenlo
Él va a llegar a un Benz con ese Datsun
Tiene esa ambición, nena, mira sus ojos
Esta semana está fregando pisos, la próxima semana son las papas fritas
Así que quédate a su lado
Sé que hay tipos bailando, y sí, eso es bueno
Y seguirán llamando e intentandolo, pero tú te quedas bien, chica
Y cuando suba, te dejará el culo por una chica blanca

(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante

Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dime, but it's time for me to quit her

La-la-la, whatever
La-la-la, it doesn't matter
La-la-la, oh, well, la-la-la

We're goin' at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop, top of the world, tonight, tonight
And we're dancin' on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it
But watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight

I woke up with a strange tattoo
Not sure how I got it, not a dollar in my pocket
And it kinda looks just like you
Mixed with Zach Galifianakis, huh?

La-la-la, whatever
La-la-la, it doesn't matter
La-la-la, oh, well, la-la-la

We're goin' at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop, top of the world, tonight, tonight
And we're dancin' on the edge of the Hollywood sign

But watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight

We can get crazy, let it all out
Just don't stop, let's keep the beat pumpin'
Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down
It's my party, dance if I want to
We can get crazy, let it all out, it's
You and me, and we're runnin' this town, and
It's me and you, and we're shakin' the ground, and
Ain't nobody gonna tell us to go
'Cause this is our show (Everybody)

Woah-oh-oh (Come on)
Oh-oh-oh (All you animals)
Woah-oh-oh (Let me hear you now)
Oh-oh-oh

Tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop, top of the world, tonight, tonight
And we're dancin' on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it
But watch how good I'll fake it

Woo
Mm, yeah

Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're goin' my way
Well, I wanna drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down, I'm back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man

There's no load I can't hold
A road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long (Woo)
If you're goin' my way
I wanna drive it all night long (All night long)
A gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah
Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long (Mm, yeah)
If you're goin' my way (You're goin' my way)
I wanna drive it all night long (All night long)

There was a distance between you and I (Between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye
Ooh, yeah (Mm, yeah)


There ain't no load that I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long (All night long, yeah)
If you're goin' my way
Well, I wanna drive it all night long (A gimme, gimme, gimme, a gimme, gimme, yeah)

I wanna ride it all night long (Woo, yeah)

We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now

And I know now that I'm so down (Hey!)

Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey

Let's get out, let's get out
'Cause this deadbeat town's only here just to keep us down
While I was out
I found myself alone, just thinkin'
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I'm so down
I made a mixtape straight out of '94
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now that I'm so down (Hey!)

هذا العالم قد يؤلمك
يجرحك بعمق ويترك ندبة
الأشياء تنهار، لكن لا شيء يُكسر مثل القلب
ولا شيء يُكسر مثل القلب

سمعتك في مكالمة الليلة الماضية
نحن نعيش ونموت بالأكاذيب الجميلة
أنت تعلم ذلك، أوه، كلينا نعلم ذلك
تلك السجائر التي تعالج همومنا
ذلك المنزل المحترق، ليس هناك ما تبقى
الدخان يعم، كلينا نعلم ذلك
لدينا طول الليل لنقع في الحب
ولكن تماماً هكذا، أنفصلنا
نحن محطمين، نحن محطمين

مم، لا شيء، لا شيء، لا شيء سينقذنا الآن

حسناً، هناك صمت محطم
بواسطة الرعد الضارب في الظلام (يضرب في الظلام)
وهذه الأغنية الحزينة
يتم تشغيلها مرارًا وتكرارًا في الحانة (يتم تشغيلها في الحانة)
هذا العالم قد يؤلمك
يجرحك بعمق ويترك ندبة

سنترك بعضنا ببرودة، تمامًا كالثلج
ومنتشين و جافين،
رياح الصحراء تهب، إنها تهب
أتذكر ما قلته لي؟
كنا مخمورين بالحب في تينيسي
وأنا مازلت أتذكره، كلينا نعلم ذلك

مم، لا شيء، لا شيء، لا شيء سينقذنا الآن
لا شيء، لا شيء، لا شيء سينقذنا الآن

Once had a love and it was a gas
It soon turned out I had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind
Once had a love and it was divine
I soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind

In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do

Once had a love and it was a gas
It soon turned out I had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone bеhind

Lost inside, adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm thе one you're using, please don't push me aside

And whether mice or men have second tries
Maybe we've been livin' with our eyes half open
Maybe we're bent and broken, broken

I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

Love the sound of the thunder rolling
It makes you move a little closer to me
Girl, I bet that your neighbors hate us
'Cause we could laugh all night and never sleep
We can worry 'bout the world in the morning
Light up a candle, lock the door
Wanna stay right here with you, yes I do

It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

Turn your radio on, baby, turn down the lights
I ain't going nowhere, I'm all yours tonight

It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over

Time stands still and then one day it's gone
Where did it go?
Where did I go?
We couldn't wait to grow old
But I can't fight the feeling anymore
You know I tried
I know you tried
We're still waiting to arrive

Ooh, how much is enough?
Ooh, how can you be sure of?
I start our day so late in the evening
Ooh, how much is enough?

Nineteen hours from my door to yours
I count the miles and all the while
Waiting for the sun to rise
But how come you can be so sure about everything when
I go to sleep you're waking up?

Ooh, how much is enough?
Ooh, how can you be sure of?
I start our day so late in the evening
Ooh, how much is enough?

Sometimes
Oh, you know it feels like
That we're on the same side of different coins
Somehow I could do more now
If we've gotta struggle
I want to struggle again

Ooh, how much is enough?
Ooh, how can you be sure of?
I start our day so late in the evening
Ooh, how much is enough?"

I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lipsticks to me
So now, I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishin' I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold, I'll be freezin'
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evenin'
Take words out of my mouth just from breathin'
Replace with phrases like, ""When ya leavin' me?""
Should I? Should I?

Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
There may be other people like us
We'll see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer, but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?

Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself

I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love"

Meet me halfway
When the sun is perched at its highest peak
In the middle of the day
Let me give my love to you
Let me take your hand
And as we walk in the dimming light
Oh, darling, understand

That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything ends

Meet me on your best behavior
Or meet me at your worst
For there will be no stone unturned
Or bubble left to burst
Let me lay beside you, darling
Let me be your man
And let our bodies intertwine
But always understand

That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything
Everything ends

A window
An opened tomb
The sun crawls
Across your bedroom
A halo
A waiting moon
Your last breaths
Moving through you

As everything, everything ends

Meet me halfway

I swear now I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby, I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair

Tryna get my Usher on but I can't let it burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn for
More and more I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinkin' all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm goin' through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

Won't let you get away, say, if we ever meet again

Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go

Won't let you get away, say, if we ever meet again

Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same, if we ever meet again

Just when the night can't get no less
Porn star startin', what is this?
Vixens fightin' for their stress
I put in like Mr. West, yes
You gon' finish dear
And your body's so superb
Me and you the best in here
But yo' girl, face of the year
Face of the year, face of the year
Face of the year, face of the year"

""Welcome to the real world"", she said to me
Condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded white hats, grabbing credits and
Maybe transfers
They read all the books, but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents, they're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories, tiny tragedies

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
As long as I'm alive

I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
I just can't wait 'til my ten year reunion
I'm going to bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for"

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh)

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waiting on you)
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you"

You good, T-Minus?

Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

Money in your palm don't make you real
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
Money in your palm don't make you real"

(D.A Got that Dope)
Hahh
آها

Slide on it pimp game with my pinky ring
سر خوردم توی یه برنامه  عشق و حال با زنگ دوست دخترم
Lotta gang, lotta bitches, and a icy chain
کلی گنگستر ،  کلی دختر و یه گردن بند آیسی چِین دور گردنم
Why you claim that you rich? That's a false claim
چرا ادعا میکنی ثروتمندی؟ ادعات دروغی بیش نیست
I be straight to the whip, no baggage claim
سریع مثل شلاق زدن آماده میشم و وسایلم و چمدونم رو جمع نمیکنم : 1 معنی
توی صف دریافت چمدون نمیرم (با جت شخصی خودم سفر میکنم)ا : 2 معنی
Whole lotta styles, can't even pronounce the name
کلی لباس های برند و استایل دارم که حتی نمیشه اسمشونو تلفظ کرد
You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram
تو هیچ برند و استایل خاصی نداری ، توی اینستاگرام میبینمت

I be rockin' it like it's fresh out the pan
یه جوری تکونش میدم که مثل یه چیز تازه از ماهیتابه میپره بیرون
(اشاره به تلاش و پشکارش / همچنین ساخت کریستال کوکایین )
Only when I'm takin' pics, I'm the middleman
فقط وقتی که عکس میگیرم نفر وسطی ام
Walk, talk it like a boss, I just lift a hand
مثل رئیس راه برو و حرف بزن ، من فقط برات دست تکون میدم
Three million cash, call me Rain Man
سه میلیون دلار پول نقد  ، مرد بارونی صدام کنید
Money like a shower, that's my rain dance
زیر پول دوش میگیرم ، برای من اینجوری بارون میاد
And we all in black, like it's Gangland
همه مون مشکی پوشیدیم
انگار اومدی توی محله ی گنگسترا
Say the wrong words, you be hangman
کلمه ی اشتباه بگی باختی (کارت تمومه!)ا
Watch me stick to your bitch like a spray tan
نگاه کن چجوری مثل چسب به دوست دخترت میچسبم(مخشو میزنم)ا

Aw, Mr. What-Kind-of-Car-He-In?
اوه اون آقاعه سوار چه ماشینیه؟
And the city love my name, nigga, I ain't gotta say it
کل شهر منو دوست دارن رفیق نیازی نیست که بگمش

(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
مزه ، مزه ، اون دختره میتونه مزه اش کنه
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
اون دختره میتونه مزه اش کنه
(Taste, taste), fuck what a nigga say
به ک*رمم نیست که اون کاکا سیاه چی میگه
It's all the same like Mary-Kate

Lotta girls like me, niggas wanna fight me
کلی از این دخترا از من خوششون میاد ، اما کاکا سیاها باهام دعوا دارن
Nigga, get your ass checked like a fuckin' Nike
کاکا سیاه حواستو جمع کن(مثل شعار نایکی فقط انجامش بده بدون حرف اضافه)ا
Me not icy, that's unlikely
من سرد نیستم ، بعیده اینطور باشه
(من شباهتی به آیسی ندارم)
And she gon' suck me like a fuckin' Hi-C
یه جوری برام ساک میزنه انگار داره آبمیوه میخوره
Aw, chains on the neck for the whole team
کل گروهم گردنبند (قیمتی) دارن
And I feel like Gucci with the ice cream
و حس میکنم گوچی مین (رپر) هستم با تتوی بستنی روی صورتش
(دارم از زندگیم نهایت لذت رو میبرم)
And my bitch want the Fenty, not the Maybelline
دوست دخترم لوازم آرایشی فِنتی میخواد نه مِیبلین
(فنتی = برند گرون قیمت لوازم آرایشی)
I'm the black JB, the way these bitches scream
من جاستین بیبر / جیمر باند سیاه پوستم واسه همینه این دخترا واسم جیغ میکشن
Make these bitches scream
کاری کن این هرزه ها جیغ بکشن / آبشونو بیار(ارضاشون کن)ا

Diamond ice glacier, niggas imitate (Ice, ice)

Ayy, ayy, feed me grapes, Maybach with the drake (Grapes)
بهم انگور بده ، ماشین مرسدس مایباخ با اردک نر

Slow pace in the Wraith, got this shit from bae (Skrrt)
با ماشین رولز رویسش توی شهر میتابه (صدای ویراژ)ا

Diamonds up to par (Par), the cookie hittin' hard (Hard)
الماس و جواهراتم اصلن،  کلوچه های ماریجواناییم بهم خیلی حال میدن

Popcorn, big shell poppin' out the cartridge (Pop it)
پوکه های تفنگم مثل پاپ کرن از اسلحه میپرن بیرون (تکونش بده)ا
(شباهت تبدیل ذرت به پاپ کرن با بیرون پریدن پوکه از تفنگ)
3400 Nawfside, Charles Barkley (Nawf)

Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah)

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’ussé with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down, we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Bitch, be humble (Hold up, bitch)
Sit down (Hold up, lil'— hold up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (Hold up, bitch)

Who that nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still'll take you down right on your mama couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 a.m. on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

In the night, I hear 'em talk (Me)
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies

I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right

How could you be so heartless? (How, how?)
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need (Bitch need)
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down

Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Said I'm heartless
So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket
Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit
Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit
Yeah, I got her watchin'
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now (Star)
I'm talkin' Time, Rolling Stone, and Bazaar now (Bazaar now)
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down (What?)
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now

Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

I lost my heart and my mind
I try to always do right
I thought I lost you this time
You just came back in my life
You never gave up on me (Why don't you?)
I'll never know what you see (Why won't you?)
I don't do well when alone (Oh yeah)
You hear it clear in my tone

'Cause I'm heartless (Ooh)
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless

Look, I just flipped a switch (Flipped, flipped)

Bodies start to drop, ayy (Hit the floor)
Now they wanna know me since I hit the top, ayy
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
This the flow that got the block hot, shit got super hot, ayy
Give me my respect (Give me my respect)

Bitch, I move through London with the Eurostep (Two)
Got a sneaker deal and I ain't break a sweat
Catch me 'cause I'm gone (Outta there, I’m gone)
How I go from 6 to 23 like I'm LeBron?
Servin' up a pack (Servin' up a pack)
Niggas pullin' gimmicks 'cause they scared to rap, ayy
Funny how they shook, ayy, got these niggas shook
Pullin' back the curtain by myself, take a look, ayy
I'm a bar spitta, I’m a hard hitta
Yeah, I’m light-skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a wig splitta, I'm a tall figure
I'm an unforgivin' wild-ass dog nigga
Somethin' wrong with 'em, got 'em all bitter
I'm a bill printer, I'm a gravedigger
Yeah, I am what I am
I don't have no time for no misunderstandings again

I let Ollie take the owl, told him brand it for me
I get 2 million a pop and that’s standard for me
Like I went blind, dog, you gotta hand it to me
(Gotta gimme that shit, dog)
Prayed, then I prayed again (Amen, Lord)
Had a moment but it came and went

You don’t wanna play with him (Nah, nah, nah)
They’ll be mournin' you like 8 a.m. (R.I.P.)
Pinky ring 'til I get a wedding ring (Woah, yeah)
Love my brothers, cut 'em in on anything (Big slice)
And you know it's King Slime Drizzy, damn (Woo, yeah)
She just said I'm bae, I hit the thizzle dance (Mac Dre shit)
Either hand is the upper hand (Oh, yeah, shit)
Got a bubba on my other hand (Woah, yeah, shit, yeah)
This shit ain't no hundred bands (Nah, nah, nah, nah)

Bills so big, I call 'em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion, for real
They been tryin' me but I'm resilient, for real
I can't go in public like civilian, for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that’s hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man, I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)
A big part of me resents

They see what I got and, man, it's hard to be content

And if you're faced with a choice and you have to choose
I hope you choose the one that means the most to you
And if one door opens to another door closed
I hope you keep on walkin' 'till you find the window

And while you're out there gettin' where you're gettin' to
I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things, too

I hope you never look back, but you never forget
All the ones who love you and the place you left
I hope you always forgive and you never regret
And you help somebody every chance you get
Oh, you'd find God's grace in every mistake
And always give more than you take

I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on the steps with my heart in my hand
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters, too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters, too

Boys, you can break
You find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters, too

So mothers be good to your daughters, too

White lips, pale face
Breathin' in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen, but lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
""The worst things in life come free to us""

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, banknotes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen, but lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
""The worst things in life come free to us""

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen, but lately
Her face seems

Crumbling like pastries
And they scream

And go mad for a couple grams

You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home, you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house, it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

It's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive
Or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives
So we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love"

Take time to realize
That your warmth is crashing down on in
Take time to realize
That I am on your side
Didn't I, didn't I tell you?

But I can't spell it out for you
No, it's never gonna be that simple
No, I can't spell it out for you

If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other
And we'll never find another
Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder if we missed out on each other now

Take time to realize
Oh-oh, I'm on your side
Didn't I, didn't I tell you?
Take time to realize
This all can pass you by
Didn't I tell you?

But I can't spell it out for you
No, it's never gonna be that simple
No, I can't spell it out for you

If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other
And we'll never find another
Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder if we missed out on each other, but

It's not the same
No, it's never the same
If you don't feel it too
If you meet me halfway
If you would meet me halfway
It could be the same for you

If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other
And we'll never find another
Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder
Just realize what I just realized
If you just realize what I just realized

Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'll be tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror's staring back at me  (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror's staring back at me, staring back at me

Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
Ooh, I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

(You good to go?)

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

All I know is we said, ""Hello""
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed"

Eres una problemática, eres una problemática
Huh, no eres nada más que una problemática, chica

Me volviste a enganchar desde el minuto que te sentaste
La forma en la que mordías tu labio hizo que mi cabeza duera vueltas
Después de un trago o dos, fui masilla en tus manos
No sé si tendré la fuerza para pararme (Oh-oh)

Proble-problemática, yeah, ese es tu segundo nombre (Oh-oh)
Sé que no eres buеna, pero estás atrapada en mi cеrebro
Y quiero saber

¿Por qué se siente tan bien pero duele tanto? (Woah)
Mi mente sigue diciendo, ""Corre tan rápido como puedas""
Digo que ya estuvo, pero luego me tiras hacia atrás (Woah)
Juro que me estás dando un ataque al corazón
Problemática

Es como si siempre estuvieras ahí en las esquinas de mi mente
Veo una silueta cada vez que cierro los ojos
Debe haber veneno en esas yemas de los dedos tuyos
Porque sigo regresando otra vez por más (Oh-oh)

Porque sigo haciendo la misma maldita cosa
Pensando que algun día vamos a cambiar
Pero sabes exactamente como revertirlo
Y hacerme olvidar mi nombre
Lo que por un demonio hagas, no lo recordaré
Me iré hasta Noviembre
Y aparecerás de nuevo el siguiente verano, yeah
Típico, tu segundo nombre es Prada
Te conformaré, chica, estoy cansado del drama
Eres una problemática
Pero maldición, chica, es como si amara el problema
Y ni siquiera puedo explicar por qué

Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it

Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream

You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home

Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse to tell herself that she okay
It seem like dyin' young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle, blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go home

I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go

Girl, please excuse me if I'm coming too strong
But tonight is the night we can really let it go

Your boyfriend's on vacation and he doesn't have to know

No one can do the things I'm gonna wanna do to you

Give me, got me good, now watch me
It's a different species, get me in DC
Let's party on the White House lawn

Equals Pitbull all night long
Pick up Barack and Michelle and let them know that it's on
Pa' fuera, pa' la calle
Dale mamita, tirame ese baile

I see you watching me, you see me watching you
I love the way you move, I like them things you do, like

Then it vanished away from my hands, dah
I had a dream I was seven
Climbin' my way in a tree
I saw a piece of heaven
Waitin' impatient for me, dah

And I was dancing in the rain

But no, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore

I was painting a picture
The picture was a painting of you
And for a moment I thought you were here
But then again, it wasn't true, dah
And all this time I have been lyin'
Oh, lyin' in secret to myself
I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf
La-di-da

And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain

Lenk' ich dich ab?
Nein
Dachte ich mir

Wie geht’s dir, junge Dame?
Das Gefühl, das du gibst, macht mich wirklich verrückt
Du bist dope, lässt einen Player ersticken
Mir fehlten die Worte, als wir das erste Mal gesprochen haben
Suchst du ein Mädchen, das dich gut behandelt?
Suchst du sie tagsüber mit dem Licht?
Du könntest der Typ sein, wenn ich meine Karten richtig ausspiele
Ich werde еs bis zum Ende der Nacht herausfindеn
Du erwartest von mir, dass ich dich einfach heranlasse?
Aber wirst du mich immer noch achten, wenn du es bekommst?
Ich kann es nur versuchen, gib mir eine Chance (Chance)
Was ist das Problem? Ich sehe den Ring nicht an deiner Hand (Hand)
Ich werde der erste sein, der zugibt
Ich du machst mich neugierig, du scheinst so unschuldig zu sein
Willst du in meine Welt eintauchen?
Junge, ich bin es leid zu rennen, lass uns kurz gehen

Promiskuitives Mädchen, wo immer du bist
Ich bin ganz allein und du bist, wen ich will
Promiskuitiver Junge, du weißt schon
Dass ich ganz dir gehöre, worauf wartest du?
Promiskuitives Mädchen, du reizt mich
Du weißt, was ich will und ich habe, was du brauchst
Promiskuitiver Junge, kommen wir zum Punkt
Weil wir sind in Fahrt, bist du bereit?

Rosen sind rot, einige Diamanten sind blau
Ritterlichkeit ist tot, aber du bist trotzdem irgendwie süß
Hey, ich kann nicht aufhören an dich zu denken
Wo bist du? Stört es dich, wenn ich vorbeikomme?
Ich bin nicht von dieser Welt, komm mit mir auf meinen Planeten
Bring dich auf mein Level, glaubst du, dass du damit umgehen kannst?
Sie nennen mich Thomas, Nachname Crown
Achte die Charm, ich lege meine nieder
Ich bin ein großes Mädchen, ich kann mit mir selbst umgehen
Aber wenn ich einsam werde, brauche ich deine Hilfe
Achte auf mich, ich rede nicht für meine Gesundheit
Ich möchte dich auf meinem Team -- So wie alle anderen
Shh, Baby, wir können es niederschwellig halten (Niederschwellig)
Entspann dich, niemand muss davon wissen (Wissen)
Wenn du dabei bist, Mädchen, ich kenne einen Ort, wohin wir gehen können
Für was für ein Mädchen hältst du mich?

Promiskuitives Mädchen, wo immer du bist
Ich bin ganz allein und du bist, wen ich will
Promiskuitiver Junge, du weißt schon
Dass ich ganz dir gehöre, worauf wartest du?
Promiskuitives Mädchen, du reizt mich
Du weißt, was ich will und ich habe, was du brauchst
Promiskuitiver Junge, kommen wir zum Punkt
Weil wir sind in Fahrt, bist du bereit?

Sei nicht böse, werde nicht gemein
Werde nicht böse, sei nicht gemein
Hey, sei nicht böse, werde nicht gemein
Werde nicht böse, sei nicht gemein

Warte, ich mein's nicht böse
Ich kann dich in meinem T-Shirt sehen
Ich kann dich ohne Klamotten
Mich abtasten sehen, bevor du das machst
Das machst? -- Du solltest wissen, was ich meine
Mädchen, ich bin ein Freak, du solltest sowas nicht sagen
Ich versuche nur, in deinen Kopf zu kommen
Um zu sehen, ob du mich so bewegen kannst, wie du sagst
Alles gut, es ist in Ordnung
Ich habe etwas, das du mögen wirst
Hey, ist das die Wahrheit oder redest du Müll?
Ist deine Leistung M.V.P. wie Steve Nash?

Promiskuitives Mädchen, wo immer du bist
Ich bin ganz allein und du bist, wen ich will
Promiskuitiver Junge, ich rufe deinen Namen
Aber du machst mich verrückt, so wie du mich warten lässt
Promiskuitives Mädchen, du reizt mich
Du weißt, was ich will und ich habe, was du brauchst
Promiskuitiver Junge, wir sind ein und dasselbe
Also müssen wir keine Spiele mehr spielen

Can't count the years on one hand that we've been together

You felt the weight of the world fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song, we sang along to the start of forever

Hit that, hit that snare

I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse

Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him right now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

I watched his wildest dreams come true
And not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving


Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now

Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now

You're all I had, you're all I had

At night when the stars light up my room

In hopes you're on the other side talkin' to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone
Talkin' to the moon?
Oh

I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad, yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know, 'cause when the sun goes down
Someone's talkin' back, yeah, they're talkin' back, oh

And your back is pretty tired
And we've drunk a couple bottles, babe
And set our grief aside
The papers say it's doomsday
The button has been pressed
We're gonna nuke each other up, boys
'Til old Satan stands impressed

And here it is, our final night alive
As the Earth burns to the ground

Oh, girl, it's you that I lie with
As the atom bomb locks in
Oh, girl, it's you I watch TV with
As the world, as the world caves in

You put your finest suit on
I paint my fingernails
Oh, we're going out in style, babe
And everything's on sale
Wе creep up on extinction
I pull your arms right in
I weep and say, ""Goodnight, love""
While my organs pack it in

And hеre it is, our final night alive
And as the Earth burns to the ground

Mbabarara, mbabarara
Mbabarara, mbabarara, mbabarara

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But Momma, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend
And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin' (Mbabarara)
I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

It's been a while since we talked last
And I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast
But Dad, I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one
Type of girl that'll make you way proud of your son
And I know you heard the last song
About the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name (Mbabarara)
I love it when she calls my phone
She's even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (Mbabarara)
It's gonna be a long drive home
But I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door, take off my coat, and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back into my arms once more for sure like

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

She's got a smile that'll make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue (I'm not done)
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise
And it doesn't stop there (Man, I swear)
She's got porcelain skin, of course she's a ten
Now she's even got her own song (But movin' on)
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours (Not sayin' one word)
And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future, she's the main component
Call it dumb, call it luck, call it love
Or whatever you call it, but
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

And don't worry 'bout it girls cause I like it like

And leave your clothes over there, that's grandma couch

These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize you with every line (Ah!)
I'll need a volunteer, how 'bout you, with the eyes? (Right there)
Come on down to the front and stand right here and don't be shy (Bobby)
I'll have you time travellin', have your mind babblin'
People tryna inherit the skill, so they askin' me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes and
I see Mindfreak like ""What's up man, what's happenin'?"" (Mindfreak!)
So come one, come all, and see the show tonight (Ha)
Prepare to be astounded, no ghost or poltergeist
You know I'm no Pinocchio, I never told a lie

Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time
I hit the stage, go insane, then jump into that crowd (Ah)
See, see, when I rhyme, I flow on the beat like pitta-da-da
See, I deceive ya with my intergalactic ether (Yeah)
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave ya with amnesia
I break all the rules like Evel Knievel (Yeah!)
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you sayin', it don't entertain my ego
I do this everyday, Hocus Pocus is my steelo

Sen benim kanımı kuruttun tıpkı asla göstermediğin gözyaşların gibi
Neden benden istediğini almıyorsun?
Benden istediğini al
Ne istiyorsan al ve git
Neden benden istediğini almıyorsun?
Benden istediğini al
Ne istiyorsan al ve git

Senden bir şeye hiçbir zaman ihtiyacım olmadı
Ve sorduklarımın hepsi gerçek içindi (sorduklarımın hepsi)
Dilini gösterdin ve ikiye ayrıldı
Zehirin ölümcüldü, neredeyse sana inanıyordum (neredeyse sana inanıyordum)
Evet, her hatam için dua ettin
Boğulmamı bekledin, boğulacağımı umarak beni daha da suya bastırdın
Veba gibi, boşa harcadım
Çıkış yolunu bulmaya çalıştım, çıkış yolumu bulmaya (çıkış yolumu bulmaya)

Ve nihayet gün geldi
Kalbimi vermeye başlıyorum
Cennetin uğruna, kemiklerim kırılacak
Ama asla ruhumun sahibi olamayacaksın, hayır

O taştan kalbinin kollarımda parçalandığını hissediyorum
Sen benim kanımı kuruttun tıpkı asla göstermediğin gözyaşların gibi
Neden benden istediğini almıyorsun?
Benden istediğini al
İstediğini al ve git
Neden benden istediğini almıyorsun?
Benden istediğini al
İstediğini al ve git

Bana attığın taşları aldım, ekibim için zincir yaptım
10 sürtük getirdim, bu araç sadece iki kişilik
Hepsi içinden geçtiler, yapacak hiçbir şey kalmadı
Bu akşam yaşamak için daha fazla nedene ihtiyacım var
Sonsuza dek yudumlayacağım ve her neyse onu alacağım
Umuyorum, ne zaman geri döneceksin diye düşünüyorum
Hadi yolumuza gidelim, hangisi?
Ne kadar sürecek dersin?
Çünkü biliyorsun asla yalnız olmayacağım

Aşk (Aşk, evet)
Ufaklık geri gitti (Ufaklık geri döndü)
Görüşe ihtiyacım var (Görüşe ihtiyacım var)
Parçala hepsini (Parçala hepsini)
Ona pipoyu ver (Ona pipoyu ver)
Bütün çetelerim (Bütün çetelerim)
Güzelim daha da kötüye gitti (Güzelim daha da kötüye gitti)

O taştan kalbinin kollarımda parçalandığını hissediyorum
Sen benim kanımı kuruttun tıpkı asla göstermediğin gözyaşların gibi
Neden benden istediğini almıyorsun?
Benden istediğini al
İstediğini al ve git
Neden benden istediğini almıyorsun?
Benden istediğini al
İstediğini al ve git

Hepsini al
Neden yapmıyorsun (Ne istersen al, ne istersen al)

'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned till the fun ran out, now

Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't

'Cause I was under them neon lights
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Everybody knew they could find me there
And right out of the blue, right out of nowhere

Sittin’ over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin' to a little “Shook Me All Night Long”
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a mornin’ you don't wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin' out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah

And now when I'm out, havin' a drink or two
If they see me, huh, they see you
'Cause, girl, I got you by my side
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Every now and then, the boys tell me they miss me
Oh but they all get it 'cause they were right there with me
Yeah with me, when

I wasn't looking for love when I walked through the door
But damn if I didn't find what I wasn't even looking for


Sittin' over in the corner, baby, I saw

Said some things I ain't proud of
I wish I could take back
Never meant to make you hurt like that, no
For a while it was perfect
You made my world standstill
Oh, and something 'bout you always will

So when it's late at night and you're still wide awake
If you're with your friends or you're lonely
When you hear somebody start to say my name
Oh, when you think of me
I hope you think good things

I hope you think, think good things
I hope you think, think good things
I hope you

Picture that night in Portland
We drank three bottles of wine
I said I love you 'bout a million times
And then we drove to Seattle
And just to kiss in the rain
Now when it's pourin', do you see my face?

So when it's late at night and you're still wide awake
If you're with your friends or you're lonely (You're lonely)
When you hear somebody start to say my name
Oh, when you think of me
I hope you think good things

I hope you think, think good things
I hope you think, think good things
I hope you

Think of the way that I started to shake when I held you for the first time
And every kiss that our lips made feel like New Year's Eve at midnight
Think of the 3 A.M. conversations, all of the big dreams that we were chasin' down
And if I ever cross your mind somehow

When it's late at night and you're still wide awake
If you're with your friends or you're lonely

When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"

Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie

What in the world does your company take me for?

Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner

You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care

You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place

Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

Just to figure out that no one would call

When you're spending everyday on your own

And they're gonna leave me here on my own

Well then I think it's time that we took a break

Maybe we're just tryin' too hard
When really, it's closer than it is too far

'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Stead of goin' under ('Stead of goin' under)
'Stead of goin' under


I can't sit back and wonder why
It took so long for this to die
And I hate it when you fake it
You can't hide it, you might as well embrace it
So believe me, it's not easy
It seems that something's telling me

I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Stead of goin' under

Instead of goin' under again
Instead of goin' under, 'stead of goin' under again
'Stead of goin' under again ('Stead of goin' under again)"

Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles
How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope, but she only found tears
And I can be so insincere
Making her promises, never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror, so how do you choose?
Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say
This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles
Now how many lovers would stay
Just to put up with this every day and all day?
How did we wind up this way?
Watching our mouths for the words that we say
As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose
How do we get there today?
When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say
This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her when she smiles
Well, your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say
This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
This is the story of a girl
Her pretty face, she hid from the world
And while she looked so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her

Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles

Przytulamy się i, tak, kochamy
I zawsze po prostu mów dobranoc (La-la-la-la-la-la)
I przytulamy się, jasne, uwielbiam to
Ale potrzebuję twoich ust na moich

Czy możesz mnie więcej pocałować?
Jesteśmy tacy młodzi, chłopcze, nie mamy nic do stracenia, oh-oh
To tylko zasada
Kochanie, przytul mnie, bo podoba mi się sposób, w jaki się rowujesz, oh-oh

Chłopcze, piszesz swoje imię, ja mogę zrobić to samo
Och, uwielbiam ten smak, la-la-la-la-la-la

Ja, czuję się jak kurwa coś
Ale moglibyśmy być ckli, pieprzyć to
Cukier, nie jestem głupkiem, głupkiem
Lubię mówić, ""A co jeśli?"" Ale jeśli
Moglibyśmy się pocałować i po prostu pokroić śmieci
Wtedy mogę być na czymś
Nie dam ci jеdnego publicznie
Daję ci setki, piеprzyć to
Coś, w co po prostu musimy się dostać
Znak pierwszy, środkowy, ostatni na zębie mądrości
Czarnuchy żałują, że cipka jest budką do pocałunku
Spróbuj śniadania, lunchu, ginu i soku
I ta kolacja też jak deser
A kiedy my Francuzi, odśwież, daj mi dwa
Kiedy przygryzę tę wargę, przyjdź po mnie też
Chce szminkę, błyszczyk do ust, malinkę też, huh

Czy możesz mnie więcej pocałować?
Jesteśmy tacy młodzi, chłopcze, nie mamy nic do stracenia, oh-oh

Kochanie, przytul mnie, bo podoba mi się sposób, w jaki się rowujesz, oh-oh

Och, uwielbiam ten smak, la-la-la-la-la-la

Powiedz, daj mi złotówkę, potrzebuję tych gushy rzeczy
Przesuń granicę, nie, nie jesteś wystarczająco dobry
Wszystkie twoje czarnuchy mówią, że przegrałeś beze mnie
Wszystkie moje suki czują się, jakbym unikł hrabstwa
Pieprzyć się z tobą czuć się jak więzienie, czarnuchu (Czuj się jak więzienie)
Nie mogę nawet wydychać, czarnuchu (Wydech)
Cipka jak święty Graal, wiesz o tym (Święty Graal)
Sprawisz, że będę potrzebował kaucji, wiesz o tym
Przyłapany na zanurzaniu się z twoim przyjacielem
Nie jesteś nawet w połowie, człowieku, kłamiesz na swoim ****, wiesz o tym
Kupiłem mi torbę pełną cegły, wiesz o tym
Kontroluj, nie zwalniaj tempa, jeśli odrzucę
Cały ten tyłek naprawdę (Cały ten tyłek)
Dramat sprawia, że czujesz (Sprawić, że czujesz)
Fantazja i bicz to wszystko, co mogę ci dać

I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
'Til the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky
What is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm

Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older too

He could be a sinner or a gentleman
He could be a preacher when your soul is damned
He could be a lawyer on a witness stand
But he'll never love you like I can, can
He could be a stranger you gave a second glance
He could be a trophy of a one night stand
He could have your humour, but I don't understand
'Cause he'll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they'll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can

A chance encounter of circumstance
Baby, he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be the silence in this mayhem, but then again
He’ll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can, can

We both have demons that we can't stand
I love your demons like devils can
If you're self-seeking, an honest man
Then stop deceiving, Lord, please

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can (Oh, like I can)

One day, when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

He said, ""I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine""

He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor

We drove around in a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah, woo

He said, ""I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter

I took a ship to the year 3000

Aber ich bin nicht die Art Mensch, die hinein passt

To get away from your parents
And I thought, ""Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out""
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair, but I thought, ""How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?""

If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

We were stayin' in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Postin' pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Gettin' drunk on the past we were livin' in

If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything

You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

When you're wearin' them worn out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark
And you're stealin' my heart like a gypsy (Stealin' my heart)
I love the way that you kiss me
In front of everybody
So baby, come and kiss me
They ain't ever seen nothin'

Nothin' like you
Shades on spinnin' in a summer rain
Dancin' when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Somethin' about you
Rockin' that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doin' your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothin' like you, yeah

Dancin' when there ain't no music

You told me that you left it all

Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men
Who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman
Who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face
And says ""Baby, uh, uh, it don't work""
You say your prayers though you don't care
You dance and shake the hurt

One, two, three, four
Mmm
Yeah
Na!
Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na nah
Na, na-na-na-na

Oh, I used to sing it
And I used to crank it with the windows down
I used to love it
Oh, but I'm over it, man, I'm over it now

I used to leave it playing on repeat
I spun that record 'til it turned on me
Yeah, the DJ knows exactly what I need
I need an ""out with the old, in with a new"" beat

You were the rooftop, at the top of my lungs
Blowing the speakers, in the back of my trunk
And you had your chance then, yeah, but I'm moving on
And now you're just yesterday's song, you're yesterday's song
The soundtrack, every night in my bed
You were the ""woo-hoo"", getting stuck in my head
Now you're just an echo, when the feeling is gone
Baby, now you're just yesterday's song, you're yesterday's song

We had a moment
There's no more magic in the melody
It's lost and you know it
It's just the sound of what we used to be

Yeah, I used to leave it playing on repeat
I spun that record 'til it turned on me
Yeah, the DJ knows exactly what I need
A little dancing could be good for me

You were the rooftop, at the top of my lungs
Blowing the speakers, in the back of my trunk
And you had your chance then, yeah, but I'm moving on
And now you're just yesterday's song, you're yesterday's song
The soundtrack, every night in my bed
You were the ""woo-hoo"", getting stuck in my head
Now you're just an echo, when the feeling is gone
Baby, now you're just yesterday's song, you're yesterday's song

Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na nah

I got a whole new ""hey""! (hey!)
I got a brand new ""woo""! (woo!)
I got new moves, and you're old news
Got a new song, I wanna sing to you
I'm gonna get by, I'm gonna get through without you

You used to be the rooftop, at the top of my lungs
Blowing the speakers, in the back of my trunk
Yeah, you had your chance then, yeah, but I'm moving on (yeah, I'm moving on)
And now you're just yesterday's song, you're yesterday's song

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentleman
Like you imagined
When you were young

Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go

We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young
When you were young

And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young

They say the devil's water — it ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentleman
Like you imagined
When you were young
(Talks like a gentleman)
(Like you imagined when)
When you were young

I said he doesn't look a thing like Jesus
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But more than you'll ever know"

It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

And ain't it funny? All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid
Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid?

From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But, if by chance, you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie, you sound like a song

Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

You still look like a movie, you still sound like a song

Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time

Then kiss me back to life to see

I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do, baby
Bring your heart, I'll bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone

Baby, don't let the lights go down

There ain't no gold in this river

So go easy on me

There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
Go easy on mе, baby

Didn't get the chance to
Feel thе world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do

And the highest hopes

We're driving slow through the snow on Fifth Avenue
And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside, but between us, it's worse in here

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's good-bye
To find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

Every day, seven takes of the same old scene
Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now before we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me?

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know (I know) this is (This is) the part
Where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's good-bye
To find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

I know you'll ask me to hold on
And carry on like nothing's wrong
But there is no more time for lies
'Cause I see sunset in your eyes

I can't take it any longer (Can't take this)
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger (It's slipping through our fingers)
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now (Try now)
All that's left's good-bye (Goodbye now)
To find a way that I can tell you (That I can tell you)

That I gotta do it, I gotta do it
I gotta do it, I hate this part
I gotta do it, I gotta do it
I gotta do it, oh
I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take these tears
I hate this part right here"

This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
It's time to make our move, I'm shaking off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years

Steady hands, just take the wheel
Every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal
For the life I lead

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here, not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I've seen?

They're trying to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could

Steady feet, don't fail me now
I'ma run till you can't walk
Something pulls my focus out
And I'm standing down

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, whoa-oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here, not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair

Chiseled their names in stone
Heavy the load you tow
And the red horse is always close
And the fire don't burn below

Two hundred miles to clear
Chasing a sound I hear
When the call brings them all to tears
And the hopes they all turn to fears

And they're walking around
With their heads in the cloud screaming
Must catch the bandit
Reckless abandon
Rundown and stranded
Must catch the bandit

Tracks in the dirt for days
Sniff out the fire ablaze
And the red door, it seems to sway
And it carries a heavy weight

And they're walking around
With their heads in the cloud screaming
Must catch the bandit
Reckless abandon
Rundown and stranded
Must catch the bandit

And they're walking around
With their heads in the cloud screaming
Must catch the bandit

Sitting on your throne
You're playing with a fireball
And posted up against the wall

And tell you that you're good enough
Tell you that it's gonna be tough

Running from the street lights
Shining on the grave

Gives them all a whirl
And gives them all the finger at it

And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication

It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
First born unicorn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication

Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station??
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there, and I don't mean on vacation
First born unicorn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication


Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving

Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mambo Number 5

One, two, three, four, five
Everybody in the car, so come on, let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna beer-bust, like I had last week
I must stay deep, 'cause talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue, you know they gettin' sweeter
So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me, flirtin' is just like a sport
Anything fly, it's all good, let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ha)

Mambo Number 5 (Ha)

Jump up and down and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound, put your hands on the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this, then you're doin' it right

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ha)

(Ha) Trumpet
The trumpet
Mambo Number 5
Ha-ha-ha

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ooh)

I do all to
Fall in love with a girl like you
'Cause you can't run and you can't hide
You and me gonna touch the sky
Mambo Number 5 (Ha)"

Hey, yeah

Ooh, how you doing, baby? (Shoop)
No, not you, you (Shoop)
The bow-legged one, haha, yeah, what’s your name? (Shoop)
Damn, baby, that sounds sexy, uh (Shoop)

Here I go, here I go, here I go again (Again)
Girls, what's my weakness? (Men!) Okay then
Chilling, chilling, minding my business (Word)
Yo Salt, I looked around and I couldn't believe this
I swear, I stared, my niece my witness
The brother had it going on with something kinda, uh (Shoop)
Wicked, wicked, had to kick it
I'm not shy, so I asked for the digits (Shoop)
A ho, no, that don't make me
See what I want, slip-slide to it swiftly
Felt it in my hips so I dipped back to my bag of tricks
Then I flipped for a tip, make me wanna do tricks on him (Shoop)
Lick him like a lollipop should be licked
Came to my senses and I chilled for a bit
Don't know how you do the voodoo that you do
So well it's a spell, hell, makes me wanna shoop-shoop-shoop (Shoop)

Shoop-a-doop, shoop-a-doop

Shoop-a-doop, shoop-a-doop

You're packed and you're stacked, 'specially in the back
Brother, wanna thank your mother for a butt like that (Thanks, Mom)
Can I get some fries with that shake-shake boobie?
If looks could kill you would be an Uzi
Or a shotgun, bang! What's up with that thang?
I wanna know, How does it hang? (Shoop)
Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover
Like Prince said you're a sexy motha— well, uh (Shoop)
I like 'em real wild, b-boy style by the mile
Smooth Black skin with a smile (Shoop)
Bright as the sun, I wanna have some fun
Come and give me some of that yum-yum chocolate chip (Come on, come on)
Honey dip, can I get a scoop? (Please)
Baby, take a ride in my coupe, you make me wanna (Shoop)

Ayy-hey

Make you get hot, make you work up a sweat
When you skip-to-my-lou, my darling
Not falling in love, but I'm falling for your
Super sperm (Hm), when I get ya
Bet your bottom dollar you are best under pressure
Yo, Sandy, I wanna, like, taste you
Getcha, getcha lips wet cause it's time to have Pep (Shoop)

On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let me shoop
To the next man in the three-piece suit
I spend all my do-re-mi, cutie
Shoop, shoop a-doobie like Scooby-Dooby-Doo (Shoop)

You make me wanna scream, ooh-ooh-ooh

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Yeah, he's a mighty, mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Yes, he is)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Oh, uh, yeah)

I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are hoes, he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic to let it
Get me involved in that he said, she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it, and believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
Hahaha, you so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby (Ow)

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Alright, yes, he is)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Oh, he's a  mighty, mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man (Ooh-ooh)
What a mighty good man (Uh, you gotta say it again now)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Yeah, hey)

My man is smooth like Barry and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home, he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me every time I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on cloud nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Mine'll rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mack ****
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like 7-Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cause good men are hard to find

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Uh, yeah, he's a  mighty, mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man (Ooh, alright)
What a mighty good man (Say it again now)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Uh, ooh-ooh)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Oh, I said what a mighty good man)

You know what I'm sayin'? He's a mighty, mighty good man, y'all
Y'all don't hear me, now check him out

My man gives real loving, that's why I call him killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker, 'cause that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that (I've got a good man)

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Uh, a mighty, mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man (Yeah, talk to 'em)
What a mighty good man (Yes, he is, oh)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (What a mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (He's a mighty, mighty good man, y'all)

Uh, what a mighty, mighty good man, y'all
Yeah, what a mighty good man
Yeah, hoo
Now break it down
A-break it down a-one time

If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me

Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol

Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was

Answer the phone
""Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?""
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

(D-D-Daytrip took it to ten, hey)
Schätzchen, ey, paar Bündel, ey
Paar Grammys auf ihn, paar Auszeichnungen, ey
Das ist Fakt, ey, twerke, ey
Twerke, ey

Und der hier geht raus an die Champions
Ich habe nicht verloren, seit ich angefangen hab', yeah
Lustig, wie ihr gesagt habt, dass es vorbei sei, yeah
Dann bin ich los und hab's nochmal gemacht

Ich hab's euch schon vor langer Zeit „On the Road“ gesagt
Ich hab' das, worauf sie warten
Ich renne vor nichts davon, Hund
Hol deine Soldaten, sag denen, dass ich mich nicht verstecke
Du warst eh nie auf meiner Seite
Wenn ich wieder oben bin, will ich euch sagen hören:
Er rennt vor nichts davon, Hund
Hol deine Soldaten, sag denen, dass die Pause vorbei ist

Ah, muss, ah
Muss das Album fertig bekommen
Brauch ein Paar Number Ones
Brauch 'ne Auszeichnung auf jedem Song
Brauch einen wie mit Nicki jetzt
Sag 'nem Rapper, dass ich dich nicht sehe, ha
Ich bin ein Pop-Star wie Bieber, ha
Ich ficke keine Bitches, ich bin queer, ha
Aber die sind Bitches wie Madea, yeah, yeah, yeah, ey (Yeah)
Oh, lass' machen
Ich baue nicht ab, ich hab einfach keinen neuen Scheiß veröffentlicht
Ich bin explodiert, jetzt will mich jeder anklagen
Du nennst mich Nas, aber die Gegend nennt mich Doobie, yeah

Und der hier geht raus an die Champions
Ich habe nicht verloren, seit ich angefangen hab', yeah
Lustig, wie ihr gesagt habt, dass es vorbei sei, yeah
Dann bin ich los und hab's nochmal gemacht

Ich hab's euch schon vor langer Zeit „On the Road“ gesagt
Ich hab' das, worauf sie warten
Ich renne vor nichts davon, Hund
Hol deine Soldaten, sag denen, dass ich mich nicht verstecke
Du warst eh nie auf meiner Seite
Wenn ich wieder oben bin, will ich euch sagen hören:
Er rennt vor nichts davon, Hund
Hol deine Soldaten, sag denen, dass die Pause vorbei ist

Mein Streckenrekord ist so sauber, dass sie nicht erwarten konnten, mich zu vermöbeln
Ich muss zu glänzend sein, ihr hättet die Welt mich vergasen lassen sollen (Wouh)
Es ist zu spät, denn ich bin hier um zu bleiben und die Mädels wissen, dass ich übel bin (Mhm)
Ich schick sie zurück zu ihrem Freund mit meinem Handabdruck auf ihrer Arschbacke
Stadtgespräche, wir machen Notizen
Sag denen, dass sie weiter posten sollen
Wünschte er könnte, aber er kommt nicht ran
OG ist so stolz auf mich, dass er sich verschluckt beim Toasts machen
Ich bin der Typ Mensch, den du nicht kontrollieren kannst, hab gesagt ich werde, also hab ich's so gemacht
Ich klär' keine Gerüchte auf (Ey) wo ist euer Sinn für Humor? (Ey)
Ich hab' aufgehört Witze zu machen, denn die sind so alt wie Baby Boomer geworden
Hab' meine Hater zu Käufern gemacht, ich lass' Veteranen sich wie Frischlinge fühlen
Sagst, dass deine Zeit bald kommt, aber genau wie Oklahoma (Mhm)
Meine kommt früher (Mhm), Ich bin nur spätreif (Mhm)
Ich war nicht auf meiner Höhe in der Highschool, ich werde immer noch knuffiger (Wouh)
All diese sozialen Netzwerke und Computer
Bringen all' die Pussys dazu, rumzurennen, als wären sie keine Loser

Ich hab's euch schon vor langer Zeit „On the Road“ gesagt
Ich hab' das, worauf sie warten
Ich renne vor nichts davon, Hund
Hol deine Soldaten, sag denen, dass ich mich nicht verstecke
Du warst eh nie auf meiner Seite
Wenn ich wieder oben bin, will ich euch sagen hören:
Er rennt vor nichts davon, Hund
Hol deine Soldaten, sag denen, dass die Pause vorbei ist

Yeah
Ich bin das Industrie-Baby, mhm
Ich bin das Industrie-Baby
Yeah"

Our love will never be another
You're just a devil undercover (Undercover)
Found you when you were in the gutter (In the gutter)
Shit was sweet until I was a sucker, shout out Jonas Brothers
I learned more than I cared to discover (Discover)
Don't you know that I'm more than a come up? (Come up)
You act up and then act like it's nothin' (Nothin')
Sold your soul, you stone cold, you a stunner (Stunner)

Every time you left (Left), shit was never right (Right)
In another bed (Bed) every single night (Night)
Had it to a science (Science), you were so precise ('Cise)
See it in your eyes (Eyes), saw you in the light (Light)
Somehow, mami, I still want you
Listen to me, don't drive away (Don't drive away)
Kill me softly, your hold on me is (Ooh)
Somethin' I can't explain

I know you could never be my bitch (Yeah)
Shit could never be like this (Oh)
I know, stop thinkin' you're in my plans (Plans)
Hunnid times you blew another chance (Chance)
I know you were gettin' down on the low (Down the low)
Then runnin' back to me in the morning (In the morning)
I know shit could never be like this
You could never be my bitch
No, no
(Oh)

Our love will never be another (Uh)
You're just a devil undercover (Undercover)
Found you when you were in the gutter (In the gutter)
Shit was sweet until I was a sucker ('Til I was a sucker, yeah)
Rather be single for life (Single for life, rather be single)
Than be fuckin' with you
I ain't rollin' the dice, no (I ain't rollin' the dice)
I ain't playin' to lose (No)

Every time you left, shit was never right (No)
In another bed (Bed) every single night (Oh)
Had it to a science, you were so precise (Yeah)
See it in your eyes, saw you in the light (Light)
Somehow, mami, I still want you (Want you)
Listen to me, don't drive away (Don't drive away)
Kill me softly, your hold on me is (Ayy)
Somethin' I can't explain

I know you could never be my bitch (Be my bitch)
Shit could never be like this (Be like this)
I know, stop thinkin' you're in my plans (Plans)
Hunnid times you blew another chance (Blew another chance)
I know you were gettin' down on the low (Down on the low)
Then runnin' back to me in the morning
I know shit could never be like this (Be like this)
You could never be my bitch
No, no

Be my bitch
It could never be like this
Shit could never be like this
It could never be like this"

You know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them
This is not to get confused
This one's for you

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)

You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)

It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around
Please turn those headlights around"
