There's a nail in the door
And there's glass on the lawn
Tacks on the floor and the TV is on
And I always sleep with my guns
When you're gone
There's a blade by the bed
And a phone in my hand
A dog on the floor, and some cash on the nightstand
When I'm all alone the dreaming stops
And I just can't stand

What should I do, I'm just a little baby
What if the lights go out and maybe
And then the wind just starts to moan
Outside the door and followed me home
Well goodnight moon, I want the sun
If it's not here soon I might be done
No, it won't be too soon 'til I say
Goodnight moon

There's a shark in the pool
And a witch in the tree
A crazy old neighbor and he's been watching me
And there's footsteps loud and strong coming down the hall
Something's under the bed
Now it's out in the hedge
There's a big black crow sitting on my window ledge
And I hear something scratching through the wall

Oh what should I do, I'm just a little baby
What if the lights go out and maybe
I just hate to be all alone
Outside the door it followed me home
Now goodnight moon
I want the sun
If it's not here soon I might be done
No, it won't be too soon 'til I say
Goodnight moon

Well you're up so high
How can you save me
When the dark comes here tonight to take
Out my front walk
And into bed where it kisses my face
And eats my head

What should I do, I'm just a little baby
What if the lights go out and maybe
And then the wind just starts to moan
Outside my door it followed me home
Now goodnight moon
I want the sun
If it's not here soon I might be done
No, it won't be too soon 'til I say
Goodnight moon
No, it won't be too soon 'til I say
Goodnight moon"

Hold the earth above me
Lay down in the green grass
Remember when you loved me
Come closer don't be shy
Stand beneath a rainy sky
The moon is over the rise
Think of me as a train goes by
Clear the thistles and brambles
Whistle 'Didn't He Ramble'
Now there's a bubble of me
And it's floating in thee
Stand in the shade of me
Things are now made of me
The weather vane will say
It smells like rain today
God took the stars and he tossed them
Can't tell the birds from the blossoms
You'll never be free of me
He'll make a tree from me
Don't say good bye to me
Describe the sky to me
And if the sky falls, mark my words
We'll catch mocking birds

Lay your head where my heart used to be
Hold the earth above me
Lay down in the green grass
Remember when you loved me
Remember when you loved me
Remember when you loved me"

I wanna hold the hand inside you
I wanna take the breath that's true
I look to you and I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colors your eyes with what's not there

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew


A stranger light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart

Fade into you

Fade into you

Remember those walls I built?
Baby, they're tumbling down
They didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make up a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget to pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

So don't you stop being a man
Just take a little look
From outside when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry

So I knew
Then one day

Visit her folks
And she ain't wanted me to go
So I stayed here
You know how they talk about a woman having that glow?
She didn't have it no more
She done cut it out
Got rid of it

Every time I think it's gone
It comes howling back

Calls me when I'm ailing
When I can't find my way home
Lost in the pines
I calls it the Black Snake Moan

Now summer's parade quietly fades on a reel
And I pulled down the lights from every last tiny limb
Tucked away signs that we'd been here
Though some may say to live this way is hiding
Not hiding, no, we are unashamed
Or running, not running, we are unafraid
Letters await, reading them late in the day
Eloquent phrase turns my heart in its cage
And how can I be so hopeless and then
So full of hope I might implode with it?

Come take him by his feet
And throw him in this deep deep well

Stranded in this spooky town
Stop lights are swaying and the phone lines are down
Floor is crackling cold
She took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun

Driven by the strangle of vein
Showing no mercy, I'd do it again
Open up your eyes
You keep on crying, baby, I'll bleed you dry
Skies, they blink at me
I see a storm bubbling up from the sea

And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer

You shimmy shook my boat
Leaving me stranded all in love on my own
Do you think of me?
Where am I now? Baby, where do I sleep?
Feels so good, but I'm old
Two thousand years of chasing taking it's toll

And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer"

Passing silhouettes of strange illuminated mannequins
Shall I stay here at the zoo? Or should I go
And change my point of view for every ugly scene?

My lover's got humour
He's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped him sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
He's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
'We were born sick,' you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
He tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you—
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

A, amen
Amen
Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
To drain the whole sea, get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean

A, amen
Amen
Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Even though Lord knows you kept mine

Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lyin' and tearin' us up

And on the Lower East Side, you're dancing with me now
And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall

Think I like you best when you're just with me and no one else

And I'm kissing you, lying in my room
Holding you until you fall asleep

Who needs a captain on a lover's ship?
Someone with no clue of the destination due, well
Ain’t that a trip?
Who needs a diamond on a hand of stone?
Someone with a hurt who couldn’t make it work
A trophy because you slipped

Love can’t conquer anything
If it’s lost without a trace
You might be tough, you might even be strong
But not when you’re in this place

Secret lovers, get lost in the secrets they tell
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
Secret lovers, it’s just your place or mine
A smoke and some wine is the life of the Black Valentine

Who needs a journey on a runaway train?
Your ticket isn’t worth half of what it hurts
When heart beats overwork
Who needs redemption from a guiltless crime?
Someone carries dreams from scream to scream
Til they tear apart your mind

Love can’t conquer anything
If it’s hurting in the deep
You’ll be awake, you’ll twist your fate
That’s not someone you should keep

Secret lovers, get lost in the secrets they tell
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
Secret lovers, it’s just your place or mine
A smoke and some wine is the life of the Black Valentine

This is their lament for another night they've spend in self-conversation
It’s a will they can't oppose in a letter left they’ve composed
To repeat the situation
They lie in a loop

Secret lovers, get lost in the secrets they tell
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
Secret lovers, it’s just your place or mine
A smoke and some wine is the life of the Black Valentine"

When it's free from the light of the sun

And the children are asleep

Fight the battle on your knees
While the sea swallows everyone (Yeah, ooh, ooh-ooh)

Or is there somewhere you have to go?
We'll keep a lantern open
In case you lose your way in the cold

That I can't stop / That I can't dream
That I can't fuck 'til I'm eighteen
That I came pop 'cause my hooks're clean
Cause my voice hurt and my words mean
That I am thirsty, that I'm crazy
That I am made to
Be a voice they
Wanted me to hated them cause I hated me

Feeling so good, feeling so gone, feeling fucked up right now
Gotta go soon, gotta go home, gotta get back to town
I don't want to be all alone anymore

There is trouble and trouble and trouble inside me
I don't want, I don't want to fight it
My women will take care of that
(She will)
There is trouble and trouble and trouble inside me
I don't want, I don't want to fight it
My women will take care of that

Would you believe in her
Like she believed in you
When she stayed
Would you believe in her
Like she believed in you
When she stayed

Yeah
I made it with my own lessons
I came from the bottom just to let it burn to ashes
Calm like a bomb, my voice is ugly like the guy behind it
Too many pain in my heart, not enough drugs to hide it
And I'll be rappin' like a mothafucka
Blood in my eyes, like I am staring at the stars above her
And I'll keep throwing her my sad songs
Until she finally come back here to save her son

And I know a woman somewhere
And I know a woman somewhere
And I know a woman somewhere"

I am a creature of habit
And I move in circles around you
I will admit there's a pattern
One I've created myself
'Cause none of my lovers dared leave me
I grew impatient and stale
Didn't look back once I'd left them
'Cause I always expected to fail

But this time it's different
The rules don't apply
But I need some distance to step out of line

So grant me this wish and meet me back here in a year
If we still exist, I can let go of my fear
Fear of normalcy
Fear of the solid walls of our future and let go of my past

I must be crazy to want this
'Cause you are the girl of my dreams
But I'm prone to ruin the good things
Cautious 'round balance it seems

But with you it is different
The rules don't apply
But I need some distance to step out of line

So grant me this wish and meet me back here in a year
If we still exist, I can let go of my fear
Fear of normalcy
Fear of the solid walls of our future and let go of my past
So grant me this wish and meet me back here in a year
If we still exist, I can let go of my fear

Kindness in your eyes
I guess you heard me cry
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
I'm blessed
I know Heaven sent and Heaven stole
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
And what have I learned from all this pain
I thought I never feel the same about anyone
Or anything again
But now I know

When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

Sadness in my eyes
No one guessed and no one tried
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
Loveless and cold
With your last breath, you saved my soul
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
And what have I learned from all these tears?
I've waited for you all those years
Then just when it began
He took your love away
But I still say

When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

So the words you could not say
I'll sing them for you
And the love we would have made
I'll make it for two
For every single memory
Has become a part of me
You will always be
My love
Well, I've been loved so I know just what love is
And the lover that I kissed
Is always by my side
Oh, the lover I still miss
Was Jesus to a child"

I set a fire to the moon's shape
We are just shadows in the cascades of history
Fetid love and then your war games
A sky released
I set our bodies on my lungs' shore
This heavy whisper makes me more scared than anything
I was loved and now that love's lost
I know they'll never find us
Way out amongst the madness

I feel free in time
Fall depths with me miles apart
In light, we solve our whole lives
In time, you breach the brighter parts
Alight, we fall

You pry me thumping from this long drop
My twisted body in a bind that you want to break
This house is covered by your bloodsport
Don't give a fuck what's taken
I hear there's wars worth making

I just leave in time
Fall depths with me miles apart
In light, we solve our whole lives
In time, you breach the brighter parts
Alight, we fall

So lay down our lips
All our mumbles, they are fabled
Bind it all up, and cast it all out into the light
And I sense all your omens
You are young, you are able
We drop from the sky
And fill our lungs to feel alive

In time
Fall depths with me miles apart
In light, we solve our whole lives
In time, you breach the brighter parts
Alight, we fall

In time
Fall depths with me miles apart
In light, we solve our whole lives
Oh in time, oh in time, you breach the brighter parts
Alight, we fall

All that we've known's in harvest smoke
This haze is our enemy
Two facts enfold my heart and stone
Nobody knows

When the winter's a lie and the forces fall
Will a silent you bring me home?
When the winter's alive and the forces form in me
I'll offset your tomb and pull you from the sea

Porcelain tide, nobody move
These phantoms and wolfish dreams
All turn to white with leaded lungs
Can you see the light twisting?

When the winter's a lie and the forces fall
Will a silent you bring me home?
When the winter's alive and the forces form in me
I'll offset your tomb and pull you from the sea

And you fall hard apart
This moonlight drowns you
And you fall miles apart
What love will solve?

When the winter's a lie and the forces fall
Will a silent you bring me home?
When the winter's alive and the forces form in me
I'll offset your tomb and pull you from the sea
When the winter's a lie and the forces fall
Will a silent you bring me home?
When the winter's alive and the forces form in me
I'll offset your tomb and pull you from the sea

From the sea, fall in me
The light gets born under us to breathe
From the sea, fall in me
You hide this war"

When it’s all said and done
And when the wolves return to hunt
And for the taste, he’ll chase it
Throw it all away to taste it
Yeah, when it’s all said and done
And when the wolves return to hunt
And for the taste, he’ll chase it
Throw it all away to taste it

He based his plans on emotion
His father tells him it's dangerous
That’s the risk that he takes, though
When he pushes his limits

This is brotherhood, 512
We all lost a brother, won’t lose two
Above money, above fame
Above love, give me truth
This is coming home drunk and sick, late night shit
Wanna punch the wall and break lights in
This is patience wearing thin
When I have it all and no one to share it with
No one to share it with
Swear to God I'm sick

Yeah, when it’s all said and done
And when the wolves return to hunt (oh)
And for the taste, he’ll chase it
Throw it all away to taste it
Yeah, when it’s all said and done
And when the wolves return to hunt (oh)
And for the taste, he’ll chase it
Throw it all away to taste it

Well I know this corpse has more to him
Stumble around, thinking out loud
That’s the way I’ve been feeling
And I know this heart still needs healing
Sticking around, out on the town
That's the way I’ve been feeling"

I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

Ooh

It's a sad song that has no end
It's a bleeding heart that never mends
A minor miracle we can still pretend
After so long
And did the apple fall too far from the tree?
And id we get lost in the space in-between?
But the roots that we buried so deep
Will always be strong

Too late for lullabies, too soon for it alright
Love takes its toll sometimes
Let's start a clean slate, mistakes are moments in time
For every time you ever raised up your hand
I'll give you mine to show you I understand
You taught me to fly by learning to fall
Oh, yeah

Love burns when it's in the blood
And God knows I burnt you the best I could
How can three words be so misunderstood?
We got it so wrong
Yeah, the greatest gift that you ever gave to me
You don't know your strength till you've faced defeat
So when everything's just out of reach
You keep holding on

Too late for lullabies, too soon for it alright
Love takes its toll sometimes
Let's start a clean slate, mistakes are moments in time
For every time you ever raised up your hand
I'll give you mine to show you I understand
You taught me to fly by learning to fall

We built a brick wall, but it's all for nothing
Only bridges will cross this divide
We both know this road leads to nowhere
There's nothing left for you to hide

Too late for lullabies, too soon for it alright
But love takes its toll sometimes

To turn the hourglass

When i close my eyes i see you
The dimples in your cheeks
I forgot to thank you for things
Cos i hadn't seen you in weeks
Woke up this morning
And hoped for a dream
But reality sat next to me
And forced me to believe
Knocked down too soon
Like a skittle on the lanes
The man took the wrong stop
From lifes's fast moving train

Goodbye sweet angel
Sail away on teary seas
Tattooed the times we had, on my memory

Funeral flowers, won't make me believe
They can carry out your casket
And i'll still expected see, you, you
Come round tomorrow
And tell me all your news
I don't ask for much from you
Sleep to my lullaby
Only give me one more chance
To say my last goodbye

From nonchalant toying games
Won't keep me warm, keep me warm
Crack the door with a trash bin
Maybe you will come back in
And keep me warm, keep me warm

My love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love
Pour the salt in the wound
My love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love
Pour the salt in the wound

Oh, life is bigger, bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
But I don't know if I can do it, do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Just a dream

Every whisper, every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this
The slip that brought me to my knees
What if all these fantasies come flailing around?
Now I've said, too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream, just a dream
Dream
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
I'm losing my religion
Trying to keep an eye on you
Oh, I don't know if I can do it, do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Why do you try?
Why do you try?
'Cause that was just a dream, just a dream, just a dream

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard a mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
There's plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year
You can find it here""

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she's got the Mercedes Bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain, said ""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise
Bring your alibis""

Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice
She said: ""We are all just prisoners here of our own device""
In the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man, ""We are programmed to receive
You can checkout any time you like, but you can never leave!"""

Not hungry now but in a while I think that all could change
Used to feel so much that it would ache
Now I've figured out, the walls surround, a holiday
True care
What does that even mean?
I needed true care
When I was 17
True care
How do you even show?
I needed true care
When I was 23 years old
You show me true care then
When you showed up to a house
Where I was drinking by myself
By the door
Spilling liquid on a carpet
That belonged to someone
I didn't even know
Or care about
Or want to show
My vivid mind
Or tragic dancing

And on my brightest days
Still duller than your darkest days
Impossible for me to say
How anyone
Deserves your true care
I'm uncomfortable
With being so uncomfortable
You let me be unreasonable
With everyone
Show me true care
True care
True care
Show me true care
And on my brightest days
Still duller than your darkest days
Impossible for me to say
How anyone
Deserves your true care
And in front of all
Our friends are so responsible
You let me be unreasonable
With everyone
Show me true care

Show me true care

To be near you for a while
There's a crane knocking down
All these things that we were
I awake in the night to
Hear the engines pout
There's a pain it does ripple
Through my frame makes me lame
There's a thorn in my side
It's the shape it's the prize
Of you and me ever changing
Moving on now moving fast
And this touch must be wanting
Must become free to act
But I mean Jake to tell you
That I love you and never rests
And I bled everyday now
For a year for a year
I did send you a note
On the wind for to read
Our names there together
Must've fallen like the sea
To the depths of the soil
Buried deep in the ground
On the wind I can hear you
Call my name held the sound
I am lost
I am lost in a rainbow
Now our rainbow is gone
I am lost in a rainbow
Now our rainbow is gone
I am lost, I am lost

When things run smooth?

Is not yet in league
With the rest of the world
And it's little intrigues
Do you understand?
Do you know what she means?
As time goes by
And when you've seen what she’s seen
You will

Why does she have to defend
Her feelings inside?
Why pretend
She's not had a life
A life of near misses
Now all that she wants
Is 3 little wishes
She wants to see with your eyes
She wants to smile with your smile
She wants a nice surprise
Every once in a while
She wants to see with your eyes
She wants to smile with your smile
She wants a nice surprise
Every once in a while

And my tears dry, get on without my guy

So far removed from all that we went through
And I, I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked, and I'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to us

I love you much, it's not enough
You love blow and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rollin' up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words

Put on a brave face
Act like an earthquake didn't come right in and tear it up
And everything we've built inside this beautiful and safe space
Here in this room where you should be
I'm losing sight of you
A stranger simply passing through again, again, again

Hearts aren't supposed to hurt like that
They're not supposed to break so fast
They say that time's a healer
How long's this burn supposed to last?

Too proud to say it, and I let you leave straight out of spite
And now I'm missing you, sometimes I wish you miss me too
Maybe you do, I'm hoping, but you're too proud to say it too
Maybe I've just been dreaming, dreaming that you'll come right back again, again, again

Hearts aren't supposed to hurt like that
They're not supposed to break so fast
They say that time's a healer
How long's this burn supposed to last?

If I could ask a smoking gun, how it feels to hurt someone
I would just ask you
If I could ask someone I love, how it feels to lose someone
I would just ask you
If I could ask a smoking gun, how it feels to hurt someone
I would just ask you
If I could ask someone I love, how it feels to lose someone
I would just ask you

Hearts aren't supposed to hurt like that
They're not supposed to break so fast
They say that time's a healer
How long's this burn supposed to last?

What if I’ve dragged you here to my own dark night
And what if I know, what if I see
There is a crack run right down the front of me

What if they’re right, what if we’re wrong
What if I’ve lured you here with a siren song?
But if I be wrong, if I be right
Let me be here with you tonight

Ten thousand cars, ten thousand trains
There are ten thousand roads to run away

But I am not lost, I am not found
I am not Dylan’s wife, not Cohen’s hound
But if I be wrong, if I be right
Let me be here with you tonight

And what if I can’t, what if I can
What if I’m just an ordinary man
If there is a will, there is a way
I will escape for sure, I am David Blaine
But if I be wrong, if I be right
Let me be here with you
If I be wrong, if I be right
Let me stay here in your arms tonight
And I have been wrong, I have been right
I have been both these things all in the same night
So if I be wrong, if I be right
Let me be here, with you, tonight"

So, show me how you make a vow

Got myself into the wrong fight
So, show me where to make amends

Baby, make my heart beat, liking what I see

Close the fear in your eyes

Rushing and played by
A brutal obsession
To shatter the buildings and throw out the line
Caught up with angels

Cause you move from this world

Searching searching for
A feeling of the tears
That burnt you to the ground

Cloaked in safety at the counter of a luxury liner with a noose in my hand

While the bulls are browsin' needles through computer casinos
Honor the name

Factor in ghettos and stack up the green paper walls for the man of the year
I'm the hero of the human highway
I'm the savior of the ethnosphere
Overdue by assassination, promoting racial vaccination and fear

Hollywood halo, the UFO light oozing from every screen
Western questions, desperate elections, campaign Halloween
We relax with our love life published, slip into something obscene
We got slime and flamingos, take the number but please don't forget about me

You have nothing to fear, my friend, except for love

We're not those kinds of freaks, amen
We're a different sort of breed of men
Up there they're drinking down the day
They mix it with a Chardonnay
They try to keep the dark at bay
Down here the darkness stays

Got bones all through the backyard

And he talks about the weather most of the time

With him it would be fine
And I walked into the doorway

My heart, it started racing
I just didn't know what to do
And he laid me on the floor
And my screams they go unheard
The lady living next door
Well she's six feet under the dirt

But I won't admit defeat
So if time is running out
And I lose you to the crowd

Your love is all I need
Show me something real

Fueled by desire
Far below
Who are we
To turn a blind eye to the truth?
And I could cross the wire
Risk the fall
Win the kill
But I want it all with you
So if time can heal the pain
Oh it leaves me wondering

Is it too late for me now

Too much gray today
I have to take my heart away from you
I need a night to breathe
You didn't bend my wings
You bit them off with your teeth
Now I can only fly when I'm with you

I am lost, I am found
Could I be both under our common ground?
I am lost, I am found
Could I be both under our common ground?

Covered in fantasies
Who was I before he invaded my mind, made the voices leave quietly?
Whenever he pulls me deeper into his dream
I can't remember if I have control or does he?
Beat me to it, I hope so
Beat me to it
Beat me to it, I hope so
Beat me to it

I felt the surge today, almost forgot my name
Keep my mouth shut, keep my clothes unbuttoned
Should I stay on this train?
I don't know what to say
To the man who makes my love darker everyday

I am found
Could I be both under our common ground?
I am lost, and I am found
Could I be both under our common ground?

Covered in fantasies
Who was I before he invaded my mind, made the voices leave quietly?
Whenever he pulls me deeper into his dream
I can't remember if I have control or does he?
Beat me to it, I hope so
Beat me to it
Beat me to it, I hope so
Beat me to it

He will love me like I loved him to begin with
I can feel it already
He's breaking under me
We are lost
We are lust
We may have found someone to trust
We are lost
We are lust
We may have found someone to trust

I am lost, I am found
Could I be both under our common ground?
I am lost, and I am found
Could I be both under our common ground?

Or maybe it's better we met as adults
You taught me how to stop thinking so much
Thinking never got me anywhere
How I spun in circles before you came

Those who know I'm a solid candidate
Believe when I say
Drugs saved my life
Showed me an open hand
I owe more than I can say
To those select days
Eyes each moment anew
I know it's not right to say
But if you've walked through those fields
Then you know what I mean
I'm sorry about those things I said
Before I met you myself
Those who hate you the most
Have never kissed you on the mouth
I'm the type
Who knows how to draw the line
So I don't visit you that often
But I live with
The knowledge of your smile

Showed me an open hand
I owe more than I can say
To those select days
Eyes each moment anew
I know it's not right to say
But if you've walked through those fields
Then you know what I mean
Where are you the rest of the time?
And why do eyes grow tired?
And I can't forget the night
That you stabbed me in the back
So I live a reasonable life
But I never forget
Those summer nights
Showed me an open hand
I owe more than I can say
To those select days
Eyes each moment anew
I know it's not right to say
But if you've walked through those fields
Then you know what I mean"

Your harbour so small the ocean so wide
Spin the wheel, spin the wheel go wherever she spins
Surrender to this wave that's rolling in
Homing fingers starting to dig
Raising expectations lifting the lid
There's a show going down going deeper within
I long to lose myself inside your skin

What a feeling under the stars
My body's rotating from venus through mars
There's a war going on between my head and my heart
I wonder how they grew so far apart
I'm so shaken, about to explode
The myth of kissing princes as they turn into toads
There's a war going on between the sun and the moon
Before they come to terms we'll be consumed

Oh my god, please take me now
I'm ready for ascension if I only knew how
Give me wings give me wings now I'm stuck on the ground
Recieve this blood and bones I'm homeward bound

See the statue growing wings
This singer was a virgin until he conceived
God is love, god is love and her lover I'll be

Dance with me around this fire
The dance of bad angels who'd love to fly higher

A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world

Followed the sun 'til night, reminiscing other times of life
For each every other the feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven, we got lost in your eyes

Lie in the sand and visualize like it's '75 again

It's a feeling of safety
Somewhere to hide where you feel free
From pressure be who you wanna be

It's just a question of being sheltered
Without being smothered
Warms without fire
Yes home
It's just a vision of life
Where you'll have a chat and wine
It's what you will do within
No move, no obligation
Home
Don't be scared it's a lie inside you
Close your eyes see the light inside of you
I'm there all the time
Home
If one day
You are feeling alone
If you need to go home
Then I'll whisper sweet words in you ear
I'll hold you in my arms and I'll sing
I'll keep you under my wing

Home
It's a place you can leave
Without fear
Of letting someone down ever
Home
Don't be scared it's a lie inside you
Close your eyes see the light inside of you
I'm in there all the time
Home
If one day
You are feeling alone
If you need to go home
Then I'll whisper sweet words in your ear
I'll hold you in my arms and I'll sing

Would it make a difference in anyway? Oh, no

Tell me you've been beaten
And what I've done to you

And you'a dog me around

There's a great change
There's a great change
Great change
There's a great change since I been born

Things I used to do, I don't do no more
Things I used to do, I don't do no more

Places I used to go, I don't go no more (Amen)

Places I used to go (Oh Lord), I don't go no more
There's a great change since I been born

You'll find my text in thе 14th chapter of St. Luke  and at the 54th vеrse. The words of the text:
""And he sat with the servants, and warmed himself by the fire.""
Subject: warming by the devil's fire.
Ah, my friend, I wanna impress upon your mind tonight, uh, the callous and unconcerned Christian who always taking . I think it's a sin and a shame, the way so many Christians who said they been born again, and they'll do anything and they'll say anything and they'll go anywhere, and then trying to convince me that you been born again. I declare to you tonight that I think that everyone that is born again ought to let your light shine. You ought to be careful 'bout— you ought to be careful how you talk, how you act, and then be careful about the company you keeping. So many people that's going 'round here come out there sinning. Th— there's no doubt in my mind about you being sent. But the question is, who sent you? Everybody that's said they're sent to preach the good word of God, they haven't been sent by my Lord, because when you've been sent by the Lord, it makes you act right, it makes you live right. And then, I declare to you tonight, I think it's a shame, going 'round here, drinking more whiskey than sinners, doing things that a hypocrite and sinner's gon' do, then trying to lead somebody. You got to get right yourself before you can lead anybody else. The blind can't lead the blind,  the blind lead the blind, they both fall in a ditch. Before your shine'll lead somebody else right, you get right yourself, then when you get right, then you can tell others to get right. If I were you tonight, I'd stop warming by the devil's fire.

Places I used to go, I don't go no more
Places I used to go, I don't go no more
Places I used to go, I don't go no more
There's a great change since I been born

And end these wretched days in bliss

Lay the stars and the moon at our feet

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
""What's going on?""

And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said ""Hey, a-what's going on?""
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said ""Hey, a-what's going on?""

Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh

And I try
Oh my God, do I try
I try all the time
In this institution
And I pray
Oh my God, do I pray
I pray every single day
For revolution

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
""What's going on?""

And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said ""Hey, what's going on?""
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said ""Hey, a-what's going on?""
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Wake in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey-ey
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said ""Hey, a-what's going on?""
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Wake in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey, yeah yeah yeah
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said ""Hey, a-what's going on?""

Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination, mmm"

Feeling uncertain like a burning old scar

For I remember the courage I had as a child
Various colors I'm hiding inside

She's a rainbow, ah...

And I am a difficult man
And I am a difficult man

Baby, I'm choking, my rhythm is smoking
I'm floating around
Shaking in the frozen Earth that I've chosen
Surfing the clouds

For I remember the joy I have had as child
Various colors I'm hiding inside

I had a dream that all of time was running dry
And life was like a comet falling from the sky
I woke so frightened in the dawning, oh so clear
How precious is the time we have here

Are we not wise enough to give all we are?
Surely we're bright enough to outshine the stars
The human kind gets so lost in finding its way
But we have a chance to make a difference til our dying day

And you might pray to God
Or say it's Destiny
But I think we are just hiding
All that we can be

Are we not wise enough to give all we are?
Surely we're bright enough to outshine the stars
The human kind gets so lost in finding its way
But we have a chance to make a difference til our dying day

All I'm really asking is: what are we doing here?
Are we just killing time? Just living year to year?
In this big world, no one else can play our part
Ain't it time to just wake up and give it all

Are we not wise enough to give all we are?
Surely we're bright enough to outshine the stars
The human kind gets so lost, and in finding its way
We have a chance to make a difference til our dying day

We have a chance to make a difference til our dying day
We have a chance to make a difference til our dying day"

Hi my name is Carmen Winstead
I'm 17 years old
I am very similar to you
Did I mention to you that I'm dead?
A few years ago a group of girls pushed me down a sewer hole to try and embarrass me
When I didn't come back up the police came
The girl said that I had fell and everyone believed them
The police found my body in the sewer
I had a broken neck and my face was torn off
Send this message to 15 peoplе after you listened thе whole message if you value your life
A boy called David received this message
He just left and deleted it
When he was in the shower he heard laughing
My laughter. He got really scared and rushed to his phone to repost this message but he was too late
The next morning his mom entered his bedroom and all she found was a message written in his blood saying 'You will never have him back'
No one has found his body yet because he is with me
A girl called Charlotte received this message and she immediately sent it to 25 people, 10 more than required
I still watch over every second of her life to make sure that she is safe and to keep her and everyone close to her out of danger
Send this to 15 people in the next five minutes if you don't want your fate to be the same as David's
Your time starts now
The story is true you can research it on Google"

You told me once I have a rebel heart
I don't know if that's true
But I believe you saw something in me that
Lives inside you too
Now all I hear is the wind
There's a storm coming through
Did I misplace or forsake my love
Now that I gave it to you?

I don't know what it is
That makes me run
That makes me wanna shatter
Everything that I've done
Why do I keep dreaming of you?
Why do I keep dreaming of you?
Is it all because of my rebel heart?

Tell me why do I keep trying
To be someone I'd never be?
I keep seeing her in everyone
Everyone but me
But I know you truly saw me
Even if just for a while
Maybe that's why it hurts now
To leave it all behind

I don't know what it is
That makes me run
That makes me wanna shatter
Everything that I've done
Why do I keep dreaming of you?
Why do I keep dreaming of you?
Is it all because of my rebel heart?
Is it all because of my rebel heart?
Is it all because of my rebel heart?
Is it all because of my rebel heart?

Nothing matters, all is futile
And it's fading fast
I fell so hard, so blindly
Had to come back and find me
I want to give so much so freely
Not have to take it back
Nothing matters, all is futile
And it's in the past"

Well, a goodbye never seems finished
Just like these songs that I write
They hang aloft like stars in the night
But there's nothing there but the illusion of a light
And you, you could've been mine

Your mother, she's an actress
And we're all putting on a play
Here's some conviction, pretend it's all real
Try to ignore how sad it all feels
Yes, try not to break her heart, if you can

Hold on to whatever you can until it's gone
Carry on, for none of us will be here for too long

I'll try not to let the world
And its darkness bring me down
Think of the love and the beauty I've found
The simple things that I've left behind
Oh the way he'd make me laugh

But I'll hold on to whatever I can until it's gone
I'll carry on, for none of us will be here for too long

You're a distant star
But darling, you're so far away
You were never meant to stay
I reach out to see
If you're still here with me
Babe, we could've made it easy
Couldn't we?

Now I will never know you
You were just someone passing by
And it makes me sad to think about
All the stories and fates I'll be without
But I think I'm getting used to the silence now"

While this town is busy sleeping
All the noise has died away
I walk the streets to stop my weeping
'Cause she'll never change her ways

But don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
Ah, my heart feels so still as I try to find the will
To forget her somehow
Oh, I think I've forgotten her now

Her love is a rose, pale and dying
Dropping her petals in land unknown
All full of wine, the world before her
Was sober with no place to go
Mmm

Don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
My heart is frozen still as I try to find the will
To forget her somehow
She's somewhere out there now


Well, my tears falling down as I try to forget
Her love was a joke from the day that we met
All of the words, all of her men
All of my pain when I think back to when
Remember her hair as it shone in the sun
The smell of the bed when I knew what she'd done
Tell yourself over and over you won't ever need her again

But don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
Oh, my heart is frozen still as I try to find the will
To forget her somehow
She's out there somewhere now

Now was that how you showed me
That you were still so young and bold
Anyway those fights did drive me
And I was dying of thirst and I wasn't growin' old

Oh, you were majesty
Your robes were heavy
And your roads were very cold
Oh, oh, oh majesty

But in my mind
I could still climb inside your bed
And I could be victorious
Still the only man to pass to the glorious arch of your head, o-oh

Oh, you were majesty
Your robes were heavy
And your cheeks very red
Oh, you were majesty
And it's like I said
That spirit, is now dead
Oh, oh, oh Majesty

Or almost dead

Yes of course
But no one really believes it
'Til they get there
For all the people laying in hospital beds
For our mothers suffering somewhere
So many living in hell
Who would kill for a night like this

You say you love me
But then you turn and walk away
All for love
Not even born yesterday
I see you on the streets
And you just pass me by
You think I got no feelings
Think I'm living high
But let me tell ya
I could be on the TV
I could be in them magazines
But it's never enough
When you felt the touch
Of an angel that's rocking your soul

When the rain comes down
You're never around
But when the sun comes up
You always steal the fire
And rain comes down
On this side of town
But people have no feelings
They just run around

They just, they just
We keep chasing dollars
It's making me holler
I just don't know
I don't need a check
I need some respect
So people you know
And the war
And the babies crying
And the car
And the house
And the rings
And the things that don't mean nothing
You could try to hate
Cause if I am right your right down
But I'm here to elevate
I'll be floating in outer space now

When the rain comes down
Will you be around?
When the sun comes up
Will you always steal my fire?
And rain comes down
On this side of town
But people have no feelings

Is there some truth to this

And you take it out on me
Where are your friends

Could they all be that bad
You ask me to hold you and then you're not there
It has something to do with your dad
I'm afraid of you
And all the things that I know love can do
It's guilt and emotion or some kind of tax
The man upstairs makes you pay
Where is the money and where is the time
That it looks like I just pissed away
I'm afraid of you
And all the things that I know love can do
Why do I put my rain into your fire
It has something to do with my mom
I'd never hurt you but I wouldn't worry if you were lost at sea
Where is my pride where is my self respect
Does it serve any purpose to you
I'd never leave I am too fucking scared of what you and your lawyers might do

The fruit that's plucked from the bitter tree is rotten old
You can find that seed sown deep in me
As a child I was taught to fear if it ever grows
So I get on my knees with a daily plea

Swallow me down and your throat will surely burn
These are the lessons I was made to learn
As I age it gets harder to resist his call
I tread lightly for if I ever fall
The devil's gonna keep me

A new love's fascination burns straight through my core
You send shivers when you touch my skin
I don't have the will to fight you anymore
So I take a bite cause I've given in

Carry me high in your arms – a sweetened embrace
We breathe harder, faster, a rhythmic pace
As I lay tangled up with you we stay here cloaked
I hear a whisper as the silence spoke
The devil's gonna keep me

Blood stained hands don't ever wash clean, wash clean
I try desperately but the stains stay seen
The fruit has fully grown and I can't bear its weight
So I dread the judgment I await

Bury me six feet underground alive or dead
Nothing can stop my fate that lies ahead
The time has come to reap the life I leave behind
In the end my soul is reassigned
The devil's gonna keep me"

De te-ar fi durut în cot cum mă durea pe mine inima, ai fi rămas în pat, lângă mine, n-ai mai fi plecat
Am închis ușa-n urma ta, răzând, strângând din dinți, să nu mă vezi plângând
Iau cheile cu mine și le-arunc să nu mă-ntorc
Îmi beau un pahar de vin cu amintiri și mă sufoc
Pentru ce-a fost, te voi iubi nespus, mai presus de toate, ți-am mai spus

Că eu nu plec pentru că nu te mai vreau
Eu plec pentru că nu mai pot să stau așa, cu tine, în lipsa ta

Știu c-o să mor de dorul tău
La bine și la rău, ne-am promis că o să fim împreună mereu
Am râs cu tine la bine și-am plâns în anii grei, doar ca să mor de dorul tău
La bine și la rău, ne-am promis că o să fim împreună mеreu
Am râs cu tine la bine și-am plâns în anii grеi, doar ca să mor de dorul tău

Uuuh, de dorul tău
Doar ca să mor de dorul tău, uuuh, de dorul tău

Dacă-o să te simt de acum doar în amintiri, știu c-o să te caut și-n alte iubiri
De-o vară sau de-o viață, nu contează, merg în față, până n-o să mai am nicio lacrimă pe față
Voiam să fim un film sau măcar un serial, dar am ajuns să fim doar cântecul de la final
Pentru ce-a fost, te voi iubi nespus, mai presus de toate, ți-am mai spus

Că eu nu plec pentru că nu te mai vreau
Eu plec pentru că nu mai pot să stau așa, cu tine, în lipsa ta

La bine și la rău, ne-am promis că o să fim împreună mereu
Am râs cu tine la bine și-am plâns în anii grei, doar ca să mor de dorul tău

Te-am iertat că te iubeam prea mult
Ai spus că nu mai faci, dar tot ai făcut
Și sufletul meu mut plânge acu', da' nu-l aude nimeni
Nici eu nu vreau să-l aud pe-al tău, că știu că te gândești la mine mereu
Mori de dorul meu la fel cum eu

Știu c-o să mor de dorul tău
La bine și la rău, ne-am promis că o să fim împreună mereu

Woke up next to you on Silver Lake Avenue

In colors on the snowy linen land

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in a violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could've told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in their ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will"

My body floats, I breathe in the water and I meet you there
We run up to the end of the stream
To that place that no one can see
And in here I will share with you my favourite dream

You were at my door
I heard you knocking but I didn't care at all
I had been in all night just staring at the wall
I didn't really want to see you anymore

Coming from the road
You took your coat off and you threw it on the floor
You said ""I can't believe you wanna hurt me so""
I said ""I'm not supposed to be like this, you know""
Well, I just had to let you go

What's on your mind?
When you're lost in time
What's on your mind?
Tell me why
Why does it have to be this way?

You were in that dream that I was dreaming
I was dreaming in a dream
Your nylon dress and I was floating back downstream
I wanted love to come and swallow everything

Everything gets real
Sooner or later, doesn't matter how you feel
You slammed that door shut on the night of glass and steel
I cannot blame you for believing what you believe
Well, I just had to let you go

What's on your mind?
When you're lost in time
What's on your mind?
Tell me why
Why does it have to be this way?

Why do you always stay
Miles away
And two steps behind
Where the past is still living
Beautiful and forgiven
Do you not see
That you live in a dream
Hey

What's on your mind?
When you're lost in time
What's on your mind?
Tell me why
Why does it have to be this way?

What's on your mind?
When you're lost in time
What's on your mind?
Tell me why
Why does it have to be this way?"

I wouldn't know where to start
If you ever were to ask me
If I ever came to see
So is this why you're proposing to me?
The front seat to ya parade, to sit and feel

Well, it seems pointless to explain
Just give it a stand
If only you'd notice
If only you'd do
I gotta stop this obsession
I've gotta stand 'bout my reason
Let the film roll without me

I'm always waitin' for what comes real
Knees break from bein' down
Seekin' a little love here and there
But I don't blame you for the end
That show the last, maybe myself for taking back

But it seems pointless to explain
I'll just give it a stand
If only you notice
If only you do
I've gotta stop stop
I gotta stop this obsession
I've gotta stand 'bout my reason
And let the film roll without me
I gotta stop this obsession
I've gotta stand 'bout my reason
And let the film roll without me"

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something

I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it

I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker

Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular

Chases every star

Hail to the night
I will wait for your call
Expecting light
Of some form to be shed

Instead, I feel the weight of your heart
See how it sinks
Instead, I feel the weight of your stone blooded heart
See how it sinks

I say, ""Lover do
You remember this face?""
Four times amused and
Rhythms fall in your place

And can you feel the weight of my stone blooded heart?
See how it sinks
And can you feel the weight of my stone blooded heart?
See how it sinks

And I hope that someday
We can share
And I hope that someday
We can share the same ground again

In my mindless pursuit of happiness
You far from me, sleepwalking down the highway
But we know that's the life or the death of me
I can't contemplate the though of you without you without me

And I hope that someday we can share

'Cause if you both got tired long enough
Something's gonna rise
'Cause if you both got tired long enough
Something's gonna rise
'Cause if you both got tired, yeah, long enough
Something's gonna rise

And I don't want to come up for air
I lost everything, I threw myself in and
You took me when no one was there
Well you can take what you need
Take the air that I breathe
And I'll give away all that I own
Whatever I lose
Is put back by you
In a way that you'll never know

'Cause I can't be without you

I'll be there when you need me most
I'll be there if you're ever alone
Together we can grow old
I can't leave you
I can't leave you, no

There's no air around me
When we get this close
But there's no where I want to go
You keep it a secret
If you feel the same
And leave me dying to know

'Cause I can't be without you

I'll be there when you need me most
I'll be there if you're ever alone
Together we can grow old

Be there whenever I'm alone

All the irony convinced a pessimist could see shallow waters as twice as deep
Well timed silence, twice as powerful as mindless speech
Eyes wide shut, fortnight sleep, that be twice as weak
But like a mortal man leaving troubles in other mortal hands
I buried my mistakes, mistaking hope should maybe understand
I've never had the answers
Fuck, I barely had a mattress
Paranoia, common practice
Promised the rest when I meet my casket
Throw my ashes to the atlas
Let them travel round its axis
Use my soul to pay my taxes
Make my music off my sadness
Oh I'll be so glad so glad, so glad when the sun goes down

Well you'll find me standing on these cold streets
Hoping that you're looking for a little bit more
Will you catch me, save me when I'm falling?
Tell me have you ever been here before?

So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage, find your lion
And take your pride and leave the past
Set sail for new horizons
So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage and find your lion
And if you hear the angel sings
Sweet Hallelujah
Hallelujah

So many faces telling the story
Like once upon a time
Blinded by the force of falling in love or
Leaving it all behind.. but
The fear of the unknown, and who to follow
Leaves me howling at the skies

Is there a purpose in what we believe?
Well I will continue to wear my heart upon my sleeves

So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage, find your lion
And take your pride and leave the past
Set sail for new horizons
So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage and find your lion

Strings as a pencil, a breath I draw for you
Indigoferra
Yes, the one and the two
A rose on a trellis
I grew for you
A rose on a trellis
Yes, the one and the two

Come on, put it in song
Tell me how you feel
Yes, come on, right from a wrong
Make it real

Just because the evidence seems clearer than day
Could it be that providence is leading you astray?
Come on, right from wrong
Time to make it real


Strings as a pencil, a breath I draw for you
Indigoferra
Yes, the one and the two
A rose on a trellis
Darling, I grew for you
Talking 'bout a rose on a trellis
Yes, the one and the two

So come on, put it in song
Tell me how you feel
Yes, come on, right from a wrong
Make it real"

And why should two loves not agree, no

Et tes yeux comme des enfants

Cool parties, whiskey on ice
You've been cheating me, right?

Fill me with lights
Dark-ness, now I need
Love, love and
Silence, silence and hell
From the night that's sour

But you did  yourself
And held tight in strong winds
You sing silently of hard times
Great highs and charity crimes
I want none of your deceptions
Except I remain hangin' down with the moss
But none of your directions pulls me close

Night of the nights
Some-thing
Fill me with lights
Dark-ness, now I need
Love, love and
Silence, silence and hell
From the night that's sour

À force de manger seul
Tu finiras par t'étouffer seul
T'es dépassé comme le Minitel
J'suis aussi amer que le Ministère
Paro, la vie, c'est nichen
Jusqu'au linceul, demande à Rafik ou bien Hichem
Tu m'dis que j'ai des milliers d'fans
Mais, dans mon cœur, moi, j'ai des millions d'thèmes
J'ai besoin de dollars
M'envie pas, j'envie les frères qui prennent le large
M'invite pas si tu sais pas manier le kalâm
Dévie pas, tu pourrais finir dans un polar, yeah
C'était la parenthèse minute peine
Y'en a même chez les militaires
Dounia m'envoie des e-mails
Et mon hymen finit dans le Finistère
Garde l'équilibre, la vie prend
La vie donne à tous et nous délivre
Le goût de vivre, c'est le monde qui raisonne-sonne
Le temps d'un rêve, le temps d'une chimère
Sois pas si naïf
Et pourquoi tu t'étonnes ?
Les roses finissent par s'incliner
Et, malgré ça, tu fais l'effort d'y croire encore, d'y croire encore

J'prends mon temps depuis l'départ
La roue tourne, mon ami, et chacun vit son quart d'heure
Mon futur à l'horizon
Et, à mi-chemin, y'a ma foi, ma raison
Désolé mais tu n'es plus dans l'coup
J'ai l'droit à l'or et au prix Goncourt
Car je crois qu'on a deux vies
Et, quand on dévie, un jour, on paye le devis
Moi, j'ai grandi dans la rue
Celle qui préfère se battre plutôt que d'attendre le mécène
J'suis pas une idole, issu d'la middle class LiDL
J'côtoie beaucoup de gens qui me limitent
Je dois me libérer de mes chaînes (de mes chaînes)

Garde l'équilibre, la vie prend
La vie donne à tous et nous délivre
Le goût de vivre, c'est le monde qui raisonne-sonne
Le temps d'un rêve, le temps d'une chimère
Sois pas si naïf
Et pourquoi tu t'étonnes ?
Les roses finissent par s'incliner
Et, malgré ça, tu fais l'effort d'y croire encore, d'y croire encore
L'aventure humaine-maine te traîne, tu cours à en perdre haleine
Mais le voyage en vaut la peine
Même si l'issue est incertaine
Ça vaut la peine, ça vaut la peine

Je n'm'avouerai pas vaincu tant qu'mon dos n'aura pas touché l'sol
Je n'm'avouerai pas vaincu tant qu'mon dos n'aura pas touché l'sol

Garde l'équilibre, la vie prend
La vie donne à tous et nous délivre
Le goût de vivre, c'est le monde qui raisonne-sonne

Feels like it's a fairy tale
You're the princess the most beautiful I've seen
I am just a prince

I can make you play
I can make you smile
I can make you safe in my foolish arms
You're my sweetest kiss
You're my immortality
You're my pretty world world
Spins inside my little mind little mind

Now we're kissing and we're saying to each other
Just a little ""I do""
But the thing is what I really want to say
It cannot be said
And I promise I will never let that death
Take you from me anyway ooh
I'll throw us stars stars stars
To wish we'll never die

You're my brightest sun
You're my crystal sea
You're my loudest rhythm
Beats inside my heart
I will make you laugh
I will make you fly
To the shiny skies

Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new
And our hearts were high
When the day was young
And the night was long
And the moon stood still
For the nightbird song
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away
But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail on the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees that worship the wind
And if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away
If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room filled with empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly 'til your next hello
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile
I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes, that I love so much
But if you go, I won't cry
The good's gone from goodbye

Of Inca treasures and hidden pots of gold

A desert like the surface of the moon
Fake a fire, eat cactus fruit and sleep beneath the stars
In the morning we'll leave for Peru
Looking high, searching low
We are travelling the face of the globe
Down the rivers and the open roads
Where adventure lies we will go
We venture the heights of machu picchu
Ignoring the danger sign on the jungle trail
The serpent's bite - it only serves to strengthen our resolve
'cause tonight is the night we set sail
Looking high, searching low
We are travelling the face of the globe
Down the rivers and the open roads
Where adventure lies we will go
We're rafting down the rapids of the Urubamba
We sail there with our pockets full of hope
Surely distant shores can't hide forever
'cause where the river goes - nobody knows

We are travelling the face of the globe
Down the rivers and the open roads
Where adventure lies we will go"

If we could find the right location

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here without that look upon your face
I should have changed my fucking lock, I would have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Oh, now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around, now, you're not welcome anymore

I'm trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me with somebody new
I'm not that stupid little person still in love with you
And so you thought you'd just drop by and you expect me to be free

I'm going to a town that has already been burnt down
I'm going to a place that has already been disgraced
I'm gonna see some folks who have already been let down
I'm so tired of America

I'm gonna make it up for all of The Sunday Times
I'm gonna make it up for all of the nursery rhymes
They never really seem to want to tell the truth
I'm so tired of you, America

Making my own way home, ain't gonna be alone
I've got a life to lead, America
I've got a life to lead

Tell me, do you really think you go to hell for having loved?
Tell me, enough of thinking everything that you've done is good
I really need to know, after soaking the body of Jesus Christ in blood
I'm so tired of America

I really need to know
I may just never see you again, or might as well
You took advantage of a world that loved you well
I'm going to a town that has already been burnt down
I'm so tired of you, America

Making my own way home, ain't gonna be alone
I've got a life to lead, America
I've got a life to lead
I got a soul to feed
I got a dream to heed
And that's all I need

Making my own way home, ain't gonna be alone
I'm going to a town
That has already been burnt down"

From the start they didn't know exactly why, why
Winter came and made it so, all look alike, look alike
Underneath the grass would grow, aiming at the sky
It was swift, it was just another wave of a miracle
But no one, nothing at all would go for the kill
If they called on every soul in the land, on the moon
Only then would they know a blessing in disguise
The curse ruled from the underground down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live like before
The curse ruled from the underground down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live like before
Tell me now of the very souls that look alike, look alike
Do you know the stranglehold covering their eyes?
If I call on every soul in the land, on the moon
Tell me if I'll ever know a blessing in disguise
The curse ruled from the underground down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live like before
The curse ruled from the underground down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live like before"

She's got a fire in her touch that can't be tamed
Wears her heart on her sleeve and her tears bring the rain
And if she loves you you'd never be the same
She'd love you and leave you just as fast as she came

She's hell on wheels, but she's heaven on Earth
She'll make you a man, she'll steal your heart
She'll love you like the devil and leave you in the night
Make everything wrong feel so right

She's got a devastating smile, and poison on her tongue
She's got a gypsy soul, and she won't stay long
And her voice, it is a siren's song
Yeah, her voice. it is a siren's song

She's hell on wheels, and she's heaven on Earth
She'll make you a man, she'll steal your heart

Shall I stay hеre at the zoo?
Should I go and change my point of view for every ugly scene?

Stranded in this spooky town
Stop lights are swaying and the phone lines are down
Floor is crackling cold
She took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun

Driven by the strangle of vein
Showing no mercy, I'd do it again
Open up your eyes
You keep on crying, baby, I'll bleed you dry
Skies, they blink at me
I see a storm bubbling up from the sea

And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer

You shimmy shook my boat
Leaving me stranded all in love on my own
Do you think of me?
Where am I now? Baby, where do I sleep?
Feels so good, but I'm old
Two thousand years of chasing taking it's toll

And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer"

These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones


Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms"

Man, y'all did it with this one here, y'all
People love to use that quote, ""I'm doin' it for the culture""
But what culture is that that you're talking about?
The one that you claim as a hip-hop artist
But won't do the research on hip-hop history
Or the one where you disrespect, disconnect
And disregard the founding fathers?
But you know what? Whatever it is, it don't even matter
'Cause as long as I'm alive
I'ma show and prove where this culture came from
And what it's really all about
I got you, my nigga, yo, ayo

Count to ten and then come in shootin' (Yeah)
Fuck peace, Silverback the new Huey Newton (D-Block)
I feel it, it's in the air, white cop with a stare
New judge in the chair, this shit hittin' the fan (Woo)
But me, I'ma be smart and legalize my shit
And I ain't leavin' the house without that in my hand (Ahh)
And it ain't only the cops, it's niggas on your block (Uh-huh)
That talk like a lil' bitch and act like they your man

Somethin' like Kris Parker, my Uzi weigh a ton
Hundred niggas on the track, then you know I'll be the one
To tell niggas to suck cock, run and get a gun
It's old P, new P, prob'ly layin' in the sun
Prob'ly on a P.I., if I call you king
I ain't talkin' 'bout rap, nigga, that status go to B.I
You can fuck around and get burnt like a C.I
More bars than jail, nigga, who tryna get a V.I?

You dealing with stock owners, conversation with stockbrokers
Make a call for coco, smokin' dope from my crop grower
The block know us, kush got a funky sock odor
How could you not notice? I come from that rock culture (Rock)
Star of the squad but they cannot coach (At all)
Louis Vuitton holster, this for my niggas in the cell
And on they wall, they got a Nicki Minaj poster
The talk's over, no drive-by's, we walked over

COB bandana tied to the end of the AR
Iller than they are, rhymes so sick, give 'em the day off
This is the chaos, Nicolas Cage, face off
The dark knight, I make it a dark night when I'm gettin' that K off
Better than whoever done it, even officers better run it
With the drum, I got a technique that'll give twelve a hundred
Now the tables turn, to whom it may concern
I used to control more shooters than David Stern
With Lucifer, hater burn

Yo, I was in the park spray-painting on the platform
Patent leather top ten, Space Invader hats on
Eighty-something, I've been a threat for that long
Where a lot of people get poked up and clapped on
My job really putting on for the city
You get popped like a wheelie for saying some old silly shit
Tell me it'll be safer to say it in Swahili
They be wheeling you away if you say it in South Philly

Look, thirty shots, I'm shootin' to peel his top (Huh?)
When them niggas sending shots, they shootin' to get the spot
That I'm in, nigga (Hahaha)
You know what it is when I spin the block (Uh-huh)
Uppin' this Draco, the witness is still in shock (Brrr!)
Fluffin' a brick of this yayo, I tilt the pot (Whip)
Tuckin' this fifth, you play with me, you getting shot (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
Yeah, niggas still waiting for me to drop (Uh-huh)
I robbed niggas for they base and sold easy rock (Ha)

Fur coats and magnums
Come through the hall with the big blammers
Bentaygas parked, let me handle this
Jewelry that's flashy, jeans is a thousand, we slick nasty
Pull out a hundred in your housing
Yeah, it's raw lingo in a Kangol
Dutch lit, nuts big as shit, taste the rainbow (Ayo, yo!)
Put your paper up and threaten shit
Or tie something up, send some messages

Ayo, ayo, I used to tell a maid, ""Sunny side up""
Basement, a chainsaw, money tied up
Paper bag over his head, so  let the crocs out
Wave a whole chicken by his legs near the croc's mouth
Sweating bullets in the tip, blow torching his flesh
I seen his face melt, drip gooey shit on his chest
Watch this motherfucker beg for mercy
Shoulda let his wiz suck my dick for that time he jerked me

The soldier I rolls with the coldest clique
Call me prototype, never had a mold to fit
My clothes is dipped, my bros is lit
Only time you been sick is when the COVID hit
Better get in line, I chop the bass like I'm pitching dimes
Code name Coffee Bean how I hit the grind
Precision design, exquisite with the vivid shine
I'm like a European watch on a different time

I used to run around with a MAC-10
Back when I was 20 years old, that was back then (30)
30 clip in the 40, move yayo like 50
Man, I hustle like Nip in the Rolling 60s
I was born in the 70's, grew up in the 80's
Got the MAC-90, then I went crazy
Do the mathematics, y'all can't compete (100)
All by myself, I'm 100 deep

I was on the first 50, now the powers at a dollar
Politician pushing tracks in it, mayor, I president in it
Til it's humbling, think you grounded and get punished
This the second time Slay needed my two cents to keep it a hundred
How you want it? Fake and be a martyr for this matrix?
They gon turn up the AC then charge you for the blankets
Lux verse mean, got you stuck standing there
Like you at a stop sign waiting for it to turn green, what you mean?

My soul is never for sale
My youngin' just did a twelve, he home, he ringing bells
Wish him well, me and mines on different times
Decline from nigga crimes, I'm fine just spitting rhymes
Read the signs, body language is loud
Cowards hang with the crowd, I ain't never changing my style
Then and now, before that was all that
Fall back, official is what you call that

I be that Third Coast legend, Dirty South icon
Shuttin' shit down, soon as they cut my mic on
From the first bar down to the last syllable
Niggas that thought they were immortal find out they killable
Once I see blood, I'm like a Great White
Catch you slippin' on a late night and it's no bark, straight bite
Watch you bleed out as reality starts to sink in
You tried the Triple OG (Bitch) what was you thinking?

I give the coke to your crew, the butter's crazy
Fallopian tube, just cut it baby
Gordo butterfly collar cover the Cubans
She need pads like Ewing, I hope you know what you doin' (Look)
Some paid 4-5 serious
I come through, 4-5, serious
Slay got me Shade 45 Sirius
Gold frame shades 45, Siri

I used to be up in a tunnel like a hundred deep
Screamin', ""Nine Trey, Su-Woo"" with a bunch of Bs
Never tied up shoes, but every night we would run the streets
Nigga, fuck growlin', it was nights I heard my stomach speak
Then I started pumpin' that bass like they done a beat
Never let shit slide 'cause they might think somethin' sweet
Nigga, it's July, shots get hot like summer heat
When I pop up, niggas turn vegan, they never wanted beef

I know these streets with my eyes closed, so my worst fear is to die slow
Lie low, 'cause in '05 you flipped to five-o
And I know, 'cause if Alpo did it to Rich
For some bricks, word to Flex, he had no reason to lie, po'
Aight though, we ain't gotta dwell on the past
Devilish laugh, arrow spins I'm ahead of the crash
Better to clash, when you handle your beef, settle it fast
Metal and mask but still keep an elegant class

Who the greatest all time? Where them niggas reside?
I seen all fifty names, man them niggas done lied
I take the first forty-eight, make them niggas retire
Last two we could joust, make them niggas my squad
Fuck them, let's see how the ladies fare
Swerve on these bitches like I'm settin' my baby hair
They feel a type way, but they never gon' take it there
They tryna keep it cute 'cause they know that it's safer there
They wouldn't dare

I can't explain what I dealt with
Know it was all weak and creep and stealth shit
When I come from under the belt with a metal shit
Forever Brownsville, numb, I never felt shit (You're as cold as ice)
I still got that real world charm, nigga, be alarmed
Body armor on, warmer in my palm (NYC)
Where you get the storm before the calm
(M.O.P.) OG and we treat it like Vietnam

My generation drank forty ounces of Old English to ease the pain
Y'all niggas drink White Claws, nigga, we ain't the same (kahm-kahm)
It's curfew whenever I come through (kahm-kahm)
Kill the fuckery, them niggas can't fuck with me (come on!)
I'm really 'bout it in the war
Taxiderm' your bitch head, mount it on the wall (it's M.O.)
Throw it up, nigga, we stand tall (it's M.O.)
You know what the fuck we stand for, it's M.O

Too many niggas in here, but never follow the script
It's movie time, release the clip and have 'em doin' a flip
Off-white Virgil, need a whip with the interior Crip
On any given goal to slide, nigga, minus the slip
Checkin' niggas outta line, like it ain't nothin' to skip
Step in my section trying to flex and end up gettin' you stripped
Too many niggas watered down, might go to sinking they ship
And if it's beef, I come to trip, I never pull up and dip
It's Precious season, nigga

Walkin' in the storm, my face had the hatred in it
Mons had the colorful money with the staples in it
Grew up street and I stay committed (Yeah)
Movin' white back and forth over green like table tennis
Guap was pourin' in, my Glock was roarin'
At nineteen, shots hit you like hydroxychloroquine
I'm still forty with the forty close
In the 840 playin' new E-40 with some horny hoes

(Yeah) Finally, y'all been waiting
To hear a verse for the economy stimulation
With Bible verses forsaken and tribal authorization
We marchin' as we awaken the mobsters across the nation
Ask doubles next to ride
The show gun with Shogun to testify
Fasho son, we hold somethin' that electrifies
N-1 L-B, no one left behind, pause it

Where I grew up in the world of Pop to give you the shot
When I vodka, the glocka Blocka! and blew the dot
You want attention? I'll give you the spot
And run up on your favorite artist aimin' at him, like, ""Do the drop""
I smack the cobble out a gobblin' blogger
Togglin' robbers with my saliva as hot as a pot of lava
And guapa, my mob has been on the sly since Yo Gabba Gabba
Trying to get the drop guava, interior baklava

Straight out the Bronx, straight off the fall
Straight off the motherfucking claw for who's settin' it off
Blocks where they spark a lot, click with the Glock a lot
Catch you at the parking lot, park you in your parking spot
Niggas know it's sex money, flex money, they do a lot
What's better than more letters and buddha spots?
Buck fifties for niggas that don't do a lot
Go ahead and get your shooter, get your shooter shot

Shaq Dies', front if you want
Flow through the spirit of Kobe, I don't puff on no blunts
My estate got a shuttle, you punks
Funny thing I got places in my place I ain't discover in months (Months)
I naturally hover above 'em, I'm Kal-El
Touchdown in the arena, the crowd yell
And if they want beef, I'm ringing the cowbell
This crispy cream make 'em ring like they found Mel

Jones, and I don't need no introduction
I'm the best, pound for pound, it's no discussion
Seen some mass destruction, this how I leave niggas area
Me, Shaq and Gunz, nothin' scarier
A nightmare on Elm Street when I hit the booth
A motivational speaker when I spit the truth
Come down to Pensacola if you need some proof
I could mess your smile up like a missin' tooth
Ahead of my time, but still in a league of my own
I tried to quit, but they just won't leave me alone
If you ain't got the right price, stop callin' my phone
M-mister, y'all must've forgot the king of the throne

Aw man! Ayo Kay!
Ayo what up Red Alert?
I don't think they ready for this
Well they better tool up cause I ain't done!

When you hear the shots
I'm not documenting, I'm 2Pac-umenting
I'm one of the Beatles, how I'm whippin' from that Lennon
Bye-bye, hater, real niggas winning
The 4th of July don't tell me I'm independent (Nah!)
I'm killing it, bro, my motive locomotive
Zero to ninety-nine like my Netflix loaded (Get em'!)
Telling your boss brick city boys is fire
Never mind, half of y'all be talking through the wire

Media slandered me, so that's why I'm slayin' you niggas
Never knew what hit him, got the doctor X-rayin' you niggas
Turned you to a victim, man, I sprinkle some yay' on you niggas
They thinkin' it's drug-related, gotta weigh on you niggas
All on the radio with the beef, got 'em sweatin' like they was Keith
And it's never gonna be peace, I'm shooting up your album release
Baggin' bricks with your niece, come and get you a piece
I'm taking responsibility for the murder increase, it's Buck

Kay wanted me to be one of the buck because I been a buck
Back when a pack of Newports was a buck, I was a young buck
On the corner of Monarch, kids from Far Rock hoppin' over the turnstile
To set up shop up top by the Jamaican spot
My joints have been a bop, from vinyl, cassettes, CDs and streams
On every Martin Luther Boulevard, they payin' homage to the shooter from Queens
Right now you wanna be this cracker from Queens
Fact though, I'm covered from special fleece to my Wallaby Supremes

This one image is unblemished without one gimmick
Your line of scrimmage, I cross it in one sentence
The core writer for those that lost sight
Of the promenade, now heed the words of the poor righteous
That build with mathematics for those whose path is empty
But y'all know math was in me for the past half a century
Now do the knowledge how the real writers do it
Cause I want the smoke, charcoal, and lighter fluid

Talk shit, but I could back up game
The way you silly motherfuckers on the mic talk the same old same
How you wouldn't hesitate to kill, buck, rack, attack
Ask him if he said to Shan, he said, ""FUCK THAT!""
Bullshit, I'm not the one to get with
Pressure gets so violent, givin' a fuck what I hit
I play your songs like a lullaby that put me to sleep
And I sing it like a pussy that's this deep

KRS is big and scary
I'm that legend, getting cream, legendary
Hear me, I rocked this, shocked this, hip-hop this
I woke and I wake up, these rappers are not this
The hotness, I would knock some of these rappers out
But you can hear they already unconscious
I got this, on the top list, fake, I'm not this
Temple of Hip-Hop, rising to the top, kid

Every verse is a persecution, it's murder music
You get cursed, the room is like army, they get the hearses movin'
Fire shit, you get burned and ruined, it's burnin' fuses
Bunch of designer, heard a human loses, deserve these bruises (Go)
Nobody tellin' me that it could ever be somebody better
I got a vendetta, I mean every word, every letter
Ahead of my time and you know not to ever put me in position
Designed to put these rappers out of commission
All I spit is dope and after this, y'all gon' need intervention
Taking it back to that driving ambition

Look up to Twista how I be killing 'em like I'm in Wimbledon
I make a sweep when I'm doing the murdering
I put the cinnamon up in the pendulum
Minimum damage I would never do, I dead 'em like a barbiturates
Omnivorous with the flow, it don't matter which bar I bit you with
I could reorganize the confusion of a child Pharaoh
Now munch on that food for thought from a piss poor pimp from the ghetto
Hmm, I am approaching so I hope you're using a radar
Causing beautiful chaos in this unusual séance

Itchy trigger finger, watch me finger fuck it, niggas bust and
Squeeze the biscuit, hit him in his English muffin, repercussion
Call the homies, niggas spray the corner, now they fallin'
On the white sheet and bars, drag rappers by they wife beater
Drama King told me ""Drag, go stupid,"" so Imma go stupid
Made this fitted cap a drop top, almost mini couped it
Stick shift, automatic, automatic big clip, round clip
Hit a nigga while I downshift, yeah

It's me again, all I be is when, never if
If you see a lens, it's probably CNN or a gif
I could rat-a-tatter, your brain matter get scattered
And served up on a platter, they call it data, baiting cappers
I'm more like Beta Kappa, I'm great like your great great grandma
And they wanna protect with this Great Lake grammar
It's Rivers, that's why I gotta be called, decide if you fall
Or have to wear a thought or break a side of the law
And fight for yours

We a hundred deep, don't give a fuck 'bout your capacity
They tell me who they favorite, I ain't hatin' but they trash to me
Y'all know this my world so I'ma hold it down like gravity
I'm bitin', that's a casualty, I'm blowin' out your cavities
Keep a pocket rocket for the people pocket watchin'
Pull up with a Glock and cock it, got you beggin' not to pop it
Y'all gotta stop, I want more cash and more fast
I went on a run like I'm all gas from all bad

You're dealing with a locksmith, my mindset is too meticulous
Rhymes melt when I sing like the wings from Kid Icarus
Every rap is indicative, diction is like a diction
I'm ditching that status quo to inhabit flows that I stitched in
You're pitching garbage, each comment is like a gauntlet
A conscious effort to execute rappers that try to test it
Ingest them and exit through my excrement through my intestine
Intestinal fortitude afforded you is what you left with

I don't smoke but stay with a cig like Mary-Kate Olsen
'Cause my patience short as D Brees or DeRozan
I ain't a Fashion Nova model that swallow rappers for follows
Just for mentions on blogs with flaws like it Apollo
But keep the toolie, pockets blue like Tookie, patience short as Uzi
You a groupie, you a rat like Mickey, you look like a goofy
Out your kufi, yeah you out your top, thinkin' you gon' move me
You like Sookie, you suck dick for chips, I'm too rich and choosy, bitch

I ain't gotta tell you what I've done, who I am or where I'm from
If you don't know it by now then you just dumb
I ain't got no pistols, inf beams, choppers or no Dracos
No car, no girlie, beams or no bankrolls
I buy shares, land, LLCs and payrolls
Kuwaiti and Bahraini dinar, gold bouillon
Mutual funds, nigga, fuck a dollar and a peso
I got seven investors that'll invest when I say so

Hey yo, max eight lines, I wrote this spinning a yarn though
Foul mind, the villainous Queens, Lance Feurtado
Mean face Murcielago, over god flows
Salute that, shit on schedule like it's Jumu'ah
I don't do the work, I just stuff bags to pass shooters
Let the foreign skirt, squeeze semi and let it squirt
All the facts, all the chow now, getting rich off of merch
Laser beams, I done turn niggas' Foamposites to red bottoms

Yeah I'm underrated and I never sold my soul
And I never switched slang to sound southern when the game changed
Niggas say they real, til you see 'em on the real
Then you find out they a bitch ass nigga, just with a record deal
For real, the internet gon' get these niggas killed
Hide behind that keyboard cuz, gon' make some blood spill
Your insecurity gon' make this .45 open up your mind and bring enlightenment
And then you'll have more clarity

If I roll a hundred deep, it's two hundred fists, two hundred feet
At least a hundred guns so every nigga get one apiece
Bitch, I'll piss on the tombstone you underneath
This sick, don't play this shit if your stomach weak
I can stomach beef, I done faced danger
I squeeze like a waist trainer then you will lose stomach meat
I run the streets, so when Cass scheme, that mean
They gotta get shot like a mandatory vaccine

Out of sight, out of mind, til I creep up behind
Double barrel shots you out, everything on your mind
Figure that, like the next line you tryna consider
But you careful so you dumb down, you ain't no spitter
Then you post, you got beef, tell me you ain't no hitter
You a tweeter, who mouth flame more than his heater
From the days of the park jams, blowin' the tweeters
Rugged raps with a DJ cut in the meetings

G-G-Get 'em!
Let me give you facts, before CashApp
I was frontin' niggas workin', they was bringing cash back
Before Instagram was selling up instant grams
Connect 'em and I can never fuck with no middle man
Before the fake jewelry and niggas with all the cappin'
40 karats in my Philly, this nigga was all platinum
Huh? You little niggas in the way
This million dollar payday's me and my nigga Kay Slay

It's the West Coastin', New Yorkin', low-ridin', Crip-walkin' nigga
Anyone can get it, masked like the pandemic
Niggas mad I don't pick up, I got multiple phones
Slay took a month to find me, got multiple homes
Pop off, my black talons will bullet your vest
(Gun noises) 300 blackout, fully suppressed
Cut through your cold crew like a saw blade
Then up at Mr. Chow's eatin' saute

Jersey Journal, where the next signal infernal
And eat chicken with friction before I try 'em, kidnap the colonel
Trigger title, trigger finger, trigger treacherous
Double shots of extortion, exercise to an exorcist
Exercise my freedom, beat 'em when I leave 'em, eat 'em
Even when the odds ain't even, I get even
With Kay Slay, fuck they play, the rebirth and replay
Mr. Slap-Your-Favorite-DJ, this all has changed on eBay
It's Jers'!

Top billing how we Gizmo and Milk shit
Grimy crimies, did all the dirt and the filth with
Yeah, my young buck days was on the real strip
Fillmore Slim shit, straight off a film strip
I ran through more fine women than Wilt did
Superstars, chem fills bitches with some soft and silk lips
Made a killing off of dealing that real fix
Numbers like a pinball wizard, tilly-tilt shit

I'm the product of Frank White
Whoever acting tough gets stage frights
Getting clearer visions of grave sights
So get my cake right, something in the bake and it ain't light
Or something in your face and it ain't life
So don't play with me, Hell gates await
When I come to the 8th, I shoot it faithfully
And tell Mitch to pray for me
Slay with the AK nigga, that's my speciality
Brooklyn forever, M.A.F.I.A 'til the death of me

Look, for my next verse I done left Earth
The internet done triple my net worth off a sweatshirt
Expert, I let the TECs work, your neck chirp
Been a devil, bench press metal, I'm doin' chest work
One of the deepest, see you've been warned
Please believe you're now lookin' at Jesus in human form
I'm Jet Li, respect me like you speakin' to Scooter Braun
The newest legend in the league, I lead with my shootin' arm
It's Payne

All you assholes finished, I don't have those limits
You'll get this work in all black, it's a black-owned business
But you cats don't get it, that's why I'm stunting on you newbies
Your father was a super fan, your mother was a groupie
That's why I trip like, ""Who you tryna rap with?""
Sounding nothing like yourself, who you tryna catfish?
Like you bodied that shit, shut your lying ass lips
Do I look like I been playing nigga? Colin Kaepernick, motherfucker

You got the memo, murder game is my M.O. (Fact though)
Lurk the frontline, not from out of the window (No!)
Take a life, then take your jewels for a memento
You make it to the outro, you got to pay for the intro
Like a nympho, ain't fuckin' around, I ain't (I'm not)
Shoota a sure shot, like a D in the paint
Don't need a long stick, just a .38, I'm straight
One dome shot, that's how I show restraint (Shoota!)

They like damn we ain't heard from you in a minute
Shit get great from my present see bitch I'm gifted
They said it's only right they callin' me cold see I'm the sickest
I heard it just like Curse of the Lottery you hoes is scripted
Don't get it twisted me and you was a difference
I'm a superstar you role playin' bitches is pimpin'
Oh and did I mention, keep me up out your mentions
You bitches ain't soldiers y'all just be wantin' attention

Hey yo New York, get the money, five boroughs of death
My dude was called, where's the money, fire, birds and meth (Hey!)
Hood Bunny, Bugs Bunny, Iceberg, and Sweats
First baguettes, Big Stepper learn the steps
Earn respect with connects 'cause my word was kept (Yes!)
Swerve the 'Vette like Sean Paul for more medicine
Fur gon' slip, like I don't spit, burn the blessed
The truth, 2Pac jewels like I serve them wet
Vado!

This homicide was prophesized before I was a toddler's size
Any job nigga, I am overqualified
I'm the kind of nigga whose cloth it be hard to find
Integrity? I put mine over dollar signs
A nigga play me, then he out his mind
As long as my niggas is winnin', I ain't gotta shine
If you can't see I'm a G, then you kinda blind
Die 'fore you disrespect me, nigga, bottom line

Return of the barbaric barbarian bar spitter
Bar 9 bar guns ballin' like bar mitzvah
You bar 9 your bars done I'm Barific
My bars gifted real rapper my bars Christmas
Cooked like a bar & grill I spit these bars in your grill
Homer bluehead keep a mag I'm Bart Simpson
My bars mention muscle bars I'm bar benchin'
Ted Danson have a beer and cheer these bars pimpin'

I see these niggas flex as if I ain't one of the best at this
And wonder why I'm attacking the mic like a pessimist
My name should be next to excellence, bless the globe
With the pestilence, like methodin', and put in work like a Mexican
A record for killin' tracks, somethin' like John Gotti
What he have, like 19? I just caught 99 bodies
Slay, I'm sorry, I know this hip-hop camaraderie
But since nobody bodied me, don't accept my apology

Stop chasing props niggas, top niggas march
By the cops, followed hot blocks, they pop niggas
I ain't one of you niggas, I'm a pair of Gators
You a pair of Uggs, you ugly but you comfortable nigga
I'm the OG, pre-Cardi nigga, the diamond in the back
Cadillac black, Pretty Ricky, Maserati nigga
The god-body, rock a party nigga
That can socially distance your head from your motherfuckin body nigga

I'm so Bronx, nigga, my middle name is Jonas
BX microphonist, also known as
The Bronx bomber, comma, hip-hop's Barack Obama
Osama, Dalai Lama, either way gon' be some drama
I'm the one even your momma fall for
I'm droppin' the bat and take it first nigga ball four
I'm roundin' the bases while niggas trip over they shoelaces
With they screwfaces, mic broke in two places

100 deep, know how we roll
Find where a nigga sleep, blowing out peepholes
Nothing never been sweet but we icy cold
Put a price on niggas' head for that shit you said
Got back so we boomerang, watch what you say
Hot shit'll spray, in a box you will lay
Know the Mobb be the gang with the Drama King
Always gonna hold it down, that's what I promised P

I did it, y'all forgot, I'm still with the scripture
Every bar has a plot and these lines are configurate
The mind over mine over mind over the pendant
I am signing on the plot I will put 'em in the blender
A dope spitter with a pro black agenda
Supported by the black referendum
And this only a sliver of the splendor
Homie it's the sensei
A dope boy with a flow no lo contendere

They told me pussy and paper go together like problems and pistols
I'm a problem to pussies who want to play with my issue
I'm pullin' rappers close, that shit you wrote was half-ass
I'm way past first class, laugh when your hearse pass
I Kill 'em with kindness, King EDI the highest
Me, Noble, Slay, you can see we the flyest
We load the spray, pussy niggas retire
100 deep, now you can watch us rise up

When 'Rock the Bells' dropped, I was locked into hip hop
Fresh off the porch with my brother Sean's boom box
Around the same time when I heard Illmatic
I was on my block, sellin' long dimes to the addicts, yeah
I remember back when Rae dropped the purple tape
We was young Outlawz, tryna raise the murder rate
Me against the world when I first heard Doggystyle
Still screamin' ""Fuck the world, doggystyle""

No more mumble rap, back to that boom bap
No cap, I'm in the trap where the goons at
Peace to all my niggas up top, getting them lunes back
Salute to the brother of me and my nigga Loon back
Harlem World's finest, let's be honest
You don't gotta give me dap, nigga, just pay homage
Peep my steps, always keep the piece on deck
I'm from the danger zone where we handle beef by death, nigga

Everybody's an opp, plenty bodies'll drop
Slay hit me up, told me body the block
Go ape the whole eight, no way they hold weight
They so fake, okay? I won't play, ya don't say?
Kay shit, basic when they spit
Face it, we not only the zone, we the matrix
Your algorithm rhythm off balance
I'm 'bout to start the ""We don't care if you die"" challange

Live from the Wire but I reside in the A
You admire the attire, I am sighin' today
No Jaden but I'm Lord Raiden
Show you with all the cadence
Lightning in my tips, with these scripts, I'm full paid in
And what a great game in heaven, boosted my cranium
Bars became za induced with titanium
Stars beyond Mars, the truth, I'm so empty
With six spliffs in the booth, it hits like Vibranium

Ayo Kay Slay, we can't let the BS slide
The game ain't been the same since DS died
Got five niggas jumping out the GS5
Will leave my gun smoking like a PS5
DS5 the street rap, somebody tell me where the streets at
This that shit to make the heat clap
From my niggas selling cheap packs
Them niggas keep straps, the Onyx is the kings of that street rap

It is Sticky, don't make me put my hands on you
Nigga, I could tell you what each one of my fingers do
My pinky finger, that's with the pink ring at
And my ring finger, never put a ring on that
And my middle finger? That's how I feel about that
I use my index finger to make that thing clap
And my thumb, I ain't got a use for that
So I put it in a bitch ass while I fuck her from the back

What you lames claim is relevant ain't
The culture's five elements, felons pistol whip your pelican vapes
I shoulda named the metal Baretta the Drake
Givin' em back to back hits 'til your skeleton breaks
Yo take a new era super head in my Wraith
Givin' me fitted call it the 7 and 1-8
Each one of my bars smoke ya whole 16
How you trap in your mom's necklace and wear big jeans?

I ace the motherfuckin' track like a pro's supposed to
I'm blowin' up in this bitch, you know, Apollonia
And anytime I did a rhyme, I did it for the culture
The doctor said I need a culture, I might have the 'rona
I beat the shit and now I'm like a hundred times stronger
Run for the block and flippin' rocks to a stock holder
Hold my composure, bring my hand up when the shots over
A hundred deep with the soldiers, and we shoulder to shoulder

Yo, I live a DJ's dream, hearin' fans scream
Cash in my hand green, they wanted to ban me
'Cause most of it was tax free, at last, me and Slay connect
Niggas know the outcome
We got mixtapes with features better than your album
Bounce Master with the Street Sweeper
For you heat seekers and them double D cup ladies and IG divas
My mixtape gave your boyfriend power
Holla at me when y'all got my flowers (Bounce)

I'm Junior Reid, I run these streets
Killin' all these hip-hop beat
Hey, I just can't be defeat
One blood family, we came here to eat
Murder!
When I roll, you know I roll deep
My hand stay strong and you know we don't cheat
Trap for the money and you know we don't sleep

If it's beef and we don't make up after talkin'
It's a high chance you gon' be wearing makeup in the coffin
I think of Busta Rhymes the way that the cops flamin' us
Like ""put your hands where I can see before it get dangerous""
Fuck twelve and whoever gave 'em information
State property parties, you want a invitation?
You don't wanna do that, family
Them people gon' have to move your family, it ain't a movie y'all

You woke up a sleeping giant, there's no one breathing this fire
It's me, I'm known globally mostly for being violent
I'm closing up both of your eyelids cause no one seeing me rhyming
Fuck quarantine, I'm outside, I'm a morbid beast on the mic
These are more than schemes that I'm writing
It's for the fiends and the piper
New cocoa leaf, it ain't Pyrex, hoping that they don't die next
Shoutout to street sweeper, I breathe ether, my team G'd up
The streets need us like cheap heaters and clean sneakers

Wais P, you should have gave me the whole song (Why?)
'Cause I'm doper than the shit Demi Lovato overdosed on
Put a ho on every corner you post on, poison potion
Give you my life on every track that I spoke on
Blow bullets 'til the barrel is hot enough to cook coke on
Phasers photon, never on stun, give you the whole drum
Wanna know why I'm on the second run? I go dumb
Plus a hundred rounds beats fifty in any gun

I can spot the lies in they lines, what lines in they eyes
Is fear, you hear? A coward cries when he dies
I was down now I'm up, they surprised by my rise
I've been out, fresh fade, bitches thought that I was Nas
Lord please forgive me, I'm a sinner
Sweat suits, gold ropes swinging like a 80s dope dealer
Trust me, I get iller, underneath the chinchilla
The street sweeper, Kay Slay with a hundred killers

Always been disrespectful, never been polite
Slay got me on the record with a bunch of niggas I don't like (I really don't though)
Them niggas corny, and their verses is not hard
Probably like ten rappers on this record that I got robbed
I'm the truth, I'm just realizing my worth
Niggas gon' turn this shit off after they hear my verse (I don't blame 'em)
And fuck whoever feel disrespected
Niggas gon' be mad Kay Slay put me on this record (Ah)

The best ever, bulletproof, the vest leather
Head shot, talkin' big bags of cheddar
Harlem, we run shit, you fags sleep
Cemetery, last stop, your bag's deep
Six feet, gun and a mask, my team creep
Mausoleum, you can see 'em, your team's sleep
Harlem, mob style, we run shit
Sheet rock, bury niggas for dumb shit

Grenades, bombs and rocket launchers
The smell of dead bodies, the odor comes back to haunt ya
Gucci vests from Dapper Dan, mountains of blow on a glass table
Look like a goddamn avalanche
Construction bags of snow, one scale
One doctor just in case your blood pressure fail
We got diesel, weed, coke and lean by the pail
Two phones next to that old bitch out in Wales

Show a sign, force on the course, it's authentic
You cross the sauce, try to be boss, get lost in it
That's a early retirement, call it a forced finish
Fuck a Porsche with horse, I put your horse with Porsche in it
Nigga Mike Cee, syllable, syllabicate
Syllabicate, it's so real, realize, realization
Realization, realize, real
S-Syllabicate, s-syllabicate, syllables, Mike Cee

I swear to God if I die tonight, I'm taking a few niggas with me
My little man just came home doing 5 so I gave him 50
I ain't gave his Dior back meaning I got this Llama with me
Run Scott my papers 50 sellin' bricks I don't fuck with dizzies
Keep a lot of shooters outside it's gon be hard to clip me
Before I surrender to God and Mississippi
Got these bitches being my mule to get some bigger titties
Falling cost me 260 got another 60 with me

Fuck y'all, thought I better talk, caught up a narrative
I sat back watching you tryna figure what bag it is
Imagine if I came back, Super Lover with savages
And put a tilting was building change the average of marriages
Cause she's still after me due to audio in audacity
For cardio and the tune grooving room at capacity
When parties over, we boom boom, for you it's gravity
A tragedy, by two masterpieces causing catastrophe

You could have a hundred verses from my hundred persons
But this one emerges
And it's curtains when you get to squirting on a piece of Birkin
Detroit is a mindset, as soon as the verse ends, you rewind it
Knowing that the Drama King was behind it
I'm Page Kennedy don't let the last man escape
Get your ass kicked by a movie star that looks more like an asterisk
Get your bifocal lens
You a fighter that wouldn't even punch vocals in

I spit stupid, you just stupid
Don't even walk off your porch, you should just stoop it
You too bitch for this goon shit, it ain't just music
We shoot you and jam to your death, no Rick Rubin
Yo my gun blow drumroll, til it unload
Or til the gun broke, then punch holes through a chump's soul
I'm muggin', it's just jokes, I'm friendly and shit
Get higher it's the highway to heaven, I'll send you a lift

(Gunplay) 7.62s, nigga never left clues
Crib looking like a motherfuckin evidence room
And I keep a street sweeper, nothing less than this broom
And that's only when I'm in a fuckin excellent mood
I got four nine-pieces on a four-door panel
Louis open-toed sandals, overdose on those samples
Living legend in the 'jects, nigga daddy every threat
Homie died in his holster, got the weapon, never left

The pandemic got niggas searching for endemic
You either win or you a dub, fuck the club, don't get it fucked up
It's still paid for the bin
And you just gotta find a fucking way in
Now we gonna see who's a boss
And rise above the COVID or take a fucking loss
Wear the mask or don't, I don't give a fuck
I'ma still get a buck and a gold medal, I will never settle

I be the block (Dynamite) so hit the sheets to the streets
Like playing games with Jamar's will beat your feet
I'ma drop a straight 8 for my nigga Kay's beat
We go back like Fat Jack my nigga Harlem heat
Got bodies for a throttle smashing King Midas
Put the drip in the game drop jewels and pop bottles
I'm valedictorian ask any historian
I'm back from streets you pullin' up in that Delorean

I'ma keep the knowledge, yeah, two cyphers
(Keep it a hundred) Lord J and Kay Slay, that's two triflers
We roll deep when we hold heat
Stay away or get sprayed with a new virus
They manufactured a new crisis
With plans to capture your third iris
I stand with the stature of the bird ibis
I'm like Dawoodi when I'm doing my duty (facts)

I'm from where Big and Hov came Pop Smoke cocaine
Rope slayin' over coats and them dope rope chains
Bed-Stuy Veteran fella been ridin'
Better than I've ever been America's bidin'
Harris no comparison since
So don't let that fly shit go to your head like Mike Pence
I got seniority Francis Sorority
Sonja Blade bitch just respect my athority

Lets take it back to the essence where it all began (Yeah)
Hip-hop, the original man (C'mon)
First emcee ain't my claim to fame
'Cause I been getting money, ain't a damn thing changed
I'm Coke La Rock and I'm still on the scene (Let's go)
The true OG to the culture you're in (Okay)
Bronx legend, respect the crown
And pay homage where it started, we call it the Boogie Down

I'm from the era catching cabs on Broadway
Put 'em on hold, ride around town all day
Way before the Uber and a Lyft it was OJ
Do the kickstep, man, just like Kid Play
We're on the east side like DJ Kay Slay
Smoke your chronic up, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre
Sprinkle my man, E-40, he from the bay
Yo I say butter man and you say Parkay

Smooth B kick shit Pelé like soccer
You that man in the middle, cockblocker
I been a G, never been a sucker
I don't hide, never scared, not a ducker
Above the Rim like I'm in Harlem at the Rucker
Motherfucker, I'm thorough with this
I ring bells around the world every borough with this

Always had the bands like Coi Leray
So I'm young enough to relate to the YouTubers
Old enough to still date a few cougars
Yet the struggle became a weapon for me
So success became a separate story
But them cheques, got 'em checkered for me
Shit, I'm shooting from Steph' territory
And I get more love than Diddy's license
We rollin' a hundred deep, and I'm the city's nicest

Look, I'm Tommy Egan in the Honda weaving
Leave your Mama grieving for the non-believing
On the deacon, Dominican mommy ganja steaming
Bomb with demons that'll take your chain and go to pond to peacing
I quit trapping cause my music is dope
You might've saw me in the lane but I'm truly the goat
You try to tell him calm down, bro was doing the most
They left him in the hospital with a tube in his throat

I trap with the guys knowing I'ma capitalize
But slaps I'ma drive to DC those capital rides
Put rappin' aside I got yak and captions to buy
She smashin' up lines so big they look like capital I's
We back in the times so start us here you back in the pines
Snap but I'm fine the Henny and the gas intertwine
I smash and I grind got the work stashed with the 9
I'm where they'll put you on a shirt like a fasion design

Yo!
You from the hood Uptown Queens New York
Save the milk cereal with the fork
Scraped the plate and now get the fuck out my way
We on the grind yes I got a lot on my mind
Back in the days I used to wanna punch them in face
I changed my ways and now I just wanna get paid
Smoking haze out a trombone Nicholas Cage
Fire tire is burning times is turning

Kaflow Kaboom rolling a hundred deep
Ever since a young wolf, I always hunted sheep
I already killed all the wolves that wanted beef
Seen a nigga brains on the floor and it made ya stomach weak
I'm from the streets where they brag about puttin' you underneath
A lot of niggas gon' get shot before the summer reach
Take you to the balcony, hang you from your feet
My office hours are from nine to five, not from one to three

A living legend like Slay on The Box
The big dime baby I'm like Jay to the opps
Purple Coogi Purple Tape I'm like Rae to the opps
When it time it ain't the mink then i'm playin' the fox
I'm sorry king of these Pradas and not Adidas
NDF We the mob and I'm the leader free the opps
Fear the law, get money, and flee the cops
Fuck the judge fuck the feds cause they the opps

Sickening, street smart but the flow ignorant
Henchmen, but never wear no Jimmy when I'm hittin' it
Big up to the game, bookstores, no more memberships
Shout out to the cub and Dior, free the innocent
Outlaw, live by often, I would die for
I get all the blame, someone get shot, they say it's my fault
So when they talk, I just pay 'em never mind
Cause when I spot em, I'ma dot em like the letter I

I'm Toussaint Louverture, unfamiliar? Google more
Gurkha out the humidor, wise man who fool 'em all
Prove 'em wrong, told Kay Slay I would do the song
Move along if you ain't about that communion, dawg
Through the fog and darkness, the world be in peril
'Til we expel the devils and renew the godly process
I'm blessed, not pressed but I'm vexed, the game culture
Brothers obeyin' other suckers who ain't of us
We reppin' that red, black and green, that's a thing
Like Pythagorean themes that put data in the machines
The latter means I saw a lot, Earth a tourist spot
Still we universal beings, this rehearsal VN
P.S., we turn T-shirts to tuxedos
With flowers from the mall with no GMOs or cheat codes
The power is in lovin' the death of your own ego
O.E. go, that's that Brooklyn

Who really the best rapper since Pun ain't here?
Y'all know the answer to that when Bamz in here
The most underrated, the most hated, the most doing the most
The most almost famous, the most favorite
Bodega getting them chips again, what happened?
First class back from Switzerland, no capping
I'm the voice they wanna silence, who said it's late?
It's perfect timing
Load up the Uzi, headshot, take the diamond

In the car with 2 blicks them shits got 3 attempts on it
You gon be the first full body
Toe tag zip em up the doc won't stitch em up
Sucka ass niggas been lollipops
Spin the block twice won't leave til a body drop
My influence in the hood is impeccable
Stir fry something turn a nigga to a vegetable
*gunshot sounds*
Hello!

It's P dot T dot K nigga
I'm back looking for drama I'm here to slay niggas
NYC tryna be A niggas
Blatant only way you figured out to get paid nigga
And let them niggas have they own style
And act like you niggas really from home
You know that where they shit was grown
And leave that drill shit alone too
Before the shot gets to drilling you
Nigga!

These rappers hoein' now, doin' anything to get papes
Even my DMs like a bitch to do a mixtape
I be killin' shit, I need a sponsorship from Ruger
Been ahead of my time, it's like I rhyme from the future
If niggas want trouble, homie, the trouble suit us
Ran up on you snakes, got me feeling like Medusa
They say they from the Bay, I'm nowhere specific
But those that don't know, nigga it's a difference

It's getting real hard to eat, no time to argue
Blow a driveway through your chest, let it park you
The broads done rip apart you
Sunset dark you, leave you hard to recharge, it'll restart you
No cinema like our own theatre scarier
Big Dubez, King Kirk, Brando, three of the thieves
Period, lyricists, storytellin'
Cordelen, split your fuckin' watermelon

4D! I go up top they take enough shots (enough shot)
Now I'm home, we see what's up then (home now)
Let you tell it, you Teddy Bruckshot
All I'm hearing is Teddy Ruxpin
Trust and believe, sleep on the D's
Get tough then, mics, I crush them
Causin' disruption, we talkin' a tusslin'
Figure four rap, nigga, fuck all the fussin'
End of discussion

I been livin' on the road for the past week (For real)
Makin' more moves than an athlete (Uh huh)
I'm from the backstreets where they pack heat
I deliver, got more drop offs than a taxi
Hated by the ones who love, shit's weird
I been seein' six figures for like six years
Young boy goin' dumb and he 'bout to go dumber
Two sticks on him, he think he a drummer

A fist up for black people, our lives matter
Like your life, but my life, they won't understand it
Traumatic stress on my hands, this is from being captured
Mutilated like castration, part of them chapters
But this a never ending story, them pages continue
My shade part of that food chain minus the menu
It's deeply rooted in genetics, the past that we've been through
Original Hebrew, got me feelin' it sacrificial

I got the power I'm putting in, punching the clock like the '99
'89 before that seventy-five
When I was around and I first rhymed
While many searched hard for punchlines
I had some that you cannot find
Had some that you can't rehearse
All I had to do was voice a verse, the Kay Slay show

Fuck chill, I think it's time that people really know
What's real, nobody else get to spin it
I know these haters won't condone, everything I own
Pointed at the throne, and I don't care who's sittin' in it
Bank on that, nobody son trust
After the clashes and the ashes come dust
You came for the fame, you gotta do what one must
But me, I'm only here to eradicate the unjust
Real talk, motherfuckers the worst
They ain't grow into fuck niggas, they were suckers from birth
Rub shoulders and then it's over, you touch 'em you cursed
I can't wait to put love in reverse
The verse woulda been iller if it wasn't for Slay
He said ""'Sau it's for the culture, not today""
I said ""Cool, and usually you're always right
But just remember culture vultures ain't always white""

DJ Kay Slay, the drama king
Rolling 110 deep
That's right!
It had to be done!
Everything revolves 360°
What comes around goes around
Bring it back to the talent over popularity
Start talkin' to the people
Instead of about the people
Don't test me
You fuck around next time
I do rolling 200 deep on you motherfuckers!"

How you got started
I hope you tell them
The truth...
When you're backstage
Making a killing
Hope you remember
All those mixtapes I made you
I was once someone's best man
Used to call him a true friend
In fact I even introduced him to his wife
Go ahead and try to blow
Reach as far as your lungs can go
Often puff, blow the whole thing down...
It's a miracle I'm still around
'Cause I don't wanna be around
When they ask you
What made me do it
I hope you tell thеm
It was the backstab that I've been through
In what world
Do you savages livе
Where you thought I'd be cool?
And I put a bullet through my heart

I was once somebody's fool
Hear that somebody's still you
Haven't given up on making you my wife
Go ahead and try to blow
Reach as far as your lungs can go
Often puff, blow the whole thing down...
It's a miracle I'm still around
'Cause all I wanna do is die

There’s something I missed
Was it something I didn’t say
Or was it something I did
When I look into my precious mirror
Well it only shows my darkest features
I try to get a grip of the old me
But you take it away when you’re on the scene
And you make it all wrong
You make it all right
The minute you’re gone
The minute you’re back
X2
I know it’s been a while since we talked
That doesn’t erase feelings
And since my pride went for a walk
I don’t answer to nothing
And there’s a thousand roles I could have played
And there’s a thousand words I could have said
And there’s a thousand rules that I never knew
And there’s a thousand fools that could be you

And you make it all wrong
You make it all right
The minute you’re gone
The minute you’re back
X2
Do we stop here and reboot computers
Or do we linger still until it crashes later
I’ll shoot my brains out again if you come back around
But I won’t suffer the blame to watch us go down
You make it all wrong
You make it all right
The minute you’re gone
The minute you’re back
X2
You know it ain’t right but you will be back
We might as well rest ’til dawn
We’re making the best of it all
Tonight we’re immune
Say we’re bulletproof
And no matter how hard we bleed
Doesn’t mean that I want to leave"

Breaking all my rules again
Choking on my gin
You push 'til I give in
'Til the loser always wins
Somehow with his beckoning
Bruising with his threads
Confusing what he says
But I won't live that way
Though I kind of want to anyway
Kind of want to play
With all the pretty and the pure
When I return to the earth
I return to the dust
No more beauty by the pound
In this I do not trust
'Cause nothing forgives
Rules and narrow margins
In our life
It's rules and narrow margins
But I'ma slip by
I can't find the time
I don't know the future
I couldn't bring that past back
I waste what little time I have

But I swear I almost touched it
Yet it slipped between my fingers
Sent shivers down my spine
Cut a splinter in my mind
But it wasn't nothing, again
These rules and narrow margins
But our life
It's rules and narrow margins
So gonna slip by
Rules and narrow margins
Rules and narrow margins

This man of mine
Breaks to be desired
This man of mine
A man to be admired
This man of mine
He reconsigned his heart
This man of mine
Isn't yours, isn't mine
Isn't yours, isn't mine

A man of glass
Awaits his days
A man, a man
Without a cause
A gaze

Even to myself sure I don't belong
Doing what I feel, even if it's wrong
Head as hard as marble floor
Sure, we could get it on
How am I to change, should I change
I think we should join forces, but the journey is solo
I sip my whiskey simply wishing to go slow
Woah, now we're ones of the hearts and photos
The moment, I revisit it, I miss it more, more
A man of steel isn't real, it don't exist
Get the gist, my weakness is them eyeballs
My weakness is affection
If it's real, keep the real
If it's fake, get the next one
And send him, look down like I just said
You understand my progression, shit
Maybe in the next life, I'll learn my lesson, I'm guessin'

Some tales are meant to stay apart
Into a vague distance
Some lives are better kept apart
Bound to be inexistent
And some tales are meant to stay apart
Into a vague distance

Don’t you worry just hold my hand, I will help you understand
Now they say every day that the end is near, but I don’t know how long ‘cause I won’t be there. You can be sure that I’ll take you along. On the rock we will sit under the sun. When the moon has its end I will want you to plea for the things I have said I will want you to see. When the changes appear and you need a friend I’ll be there again and again and again
Please pay attention now the mad is here I’m always the last to know

Standing alone in a crowded room with nowhere left to go
Feeling out and left alone where the days are dry and cold"

There's traffic in the sky
And it doesn't seem to be getting much better
There's kids playing games on the pavement
Drawin' waves on the pavement, mm-mm
Shadows of the planes on the pavement, mm-mm

It's enough to make me cry
But that don't seem like it would make it feel better
Maybe it's a dream and if I scream it will burst at the seams
Whole place would fall into pieces
And then they'd say

Well how could we have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell, nah, nah, nah
If you keep addin' stones
Soon the water will be lost in the well, mm

And puzzle pieces in the ground
No one ever seems to be diggin'
Instead they're lookin' up towards the heavens
With their eyes on the heavens, mm-mm
The shadows on the way to the heavens, mm-mm

It's enough to make me cry
But that don't seem like it would make it feel better
The answers could be found, we could learn from diggin' down
But no one ever seems to be diggin'
Instead they'll say

Well how could we have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell, nah, nah, nah

Soon the water will be lost in the well, mm

And words of wisdom all around
But no one ever seems to listen

The shadows from the scrapers on the pavement, mm-mm

But that don't seem like it would make it feel better

And no one ever seems to listen
Instead they'll say

Then Every Head Turned With Eyes That Dreamed Of Being The One

And Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts
And Mother Always Told Me Be Careful Of Who You Love
And Be Careful Of What You Do before The Lie Becomes The Truth

She's Just A Girl Who says That I Am The One
But The Kid Is Not My Son
She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son
For Forty Days And for Forty Nights
The Law was on her Side
But Who Can Stand When She's In Demand
Her Schemes And Plans
'Cause We Danced On The Floor In The Round
So Take My Strong Advice, Just Remember To Always Think Twice

She Told My Baby We'd Danced 'Til Three
Then She Looked At Me
She Showed A Photo Of A Baby Crying
His Eyes Looked Like Mine
Coz we Dance On The Floor In The Round
People Always Told Me Be Careful Of What You Do
Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts
Than She  Stood Right By Me
Then The Smell Of Sweet Perfume
This Happened Much Too Soon
She Called Me To Her Room

Was it the trick of the light or a shot in the dark?
Was it hell or high water that broke our hearts?
Was it something I said, or just a cruel twist of fate?
Was it hell or high water and is it too late?
Oh, is it too late?

Man, all my life I've been searching for someone
To show me how it feels to be loved, and
How to love somebody back
And after stumbling through the years, I
Thought I found you just to
See you fading out into the night

Was it the trick of the light or a shot in the dark?
Was it hell or high water that broke our hearts?
Was it something you said, or just a cruel twist of fate?
Was it hell or high water and is it too late?

See, all my life I've been silently reaching for
A hand to hold to warm the cold, spark a light
To guide me through alright
And after stumbling through the years
I thought I found you, just to
See you fading out into the night

Was it the trick of the light or a shot in the dark?
Was it hell or high water that broke our hearts?
Was it something we did, or just a cruel twist of fate?
Was it hell or high water and is it too late?

Hey, hey
Hey, hey

Was it a knife in my back or a fork in the road?
Was it hell or high water that left us alone?
Is it really game over? Is it really checkmate?
Was it hell or high water and is it too late?
Oh, is it too late?

Was it the trick of the light or a shot in the dark?
Was it hell or high water that broke her heart?"

Staring at the wall
Looking in the mirror
Trying not to fall
Trying to be careful
Trying to be pure
I wanna be honest
I wanna be sure
But all I can see, is a
Big black dark
I'm trying to comb through the
Tangled thoughts
I don’t wanna stay here
And I don't wanna go
I don't see it coming
I don’t want it all

Take another story
Take another frame
Take another figure
Take another name
Take another person
Take another life
Take another problem
Take another strife
Take another demon
Take another space
Take another dream and
Take another faith
Take another rise and
Take another fall

I don't want it all
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna lie
I don't wanna hurt you but
I don't wanna cry, oh

In time you will learn there's us and them
And don't take that walk
It's not you that steps back, tonight
You fought with those demons
And the fears that were left, inside
This heart of mine whispers
That I'm not done with what I call the past
And I trust your halo
And those words that made up your mind

I'll leave you for someone tonight

Something hides in every night
Brings desire from the deep
And with it comes a burning light
To keep us from our sleep

And as the full star tries his best to make the white pearl shine
Glances of a new day have arrived
And though he’s not alone, he fears to never love another
And leave his heart forever with her smile

Haa-aah

Habibi, light is burning
As I am burning
Habibi, light is burning
As I am yearning

Something died within a soul
Left the eyes to rust
And every time it is recalled
It covers all in dust

Haa-aah

Habibi, light is burning
As I am burning
Habibi, light is burning
As I am yearning

And meanwhile, a whole lot goes down
Somewhere in the darkness, us together for a while
You loved it then, so did I
A feeling deep inside you wants to love it all again
Now don’t leave it there, just give it a chance
If only I’d forget you after one last dance
But you’re everywhere, yes you are
In every melody and in every little scar
Yes you are, you are, love

Habibi, light is burning
As I am burning
Habibi, light is burning
And I am yearning"

And the things you say will be touching me from far away

Before it gets so stoned in the

Just for the oldest things to feel new again
Easy living on the taste of colors
The root gets so dry in the

To billion years gone through the ring of corruption

And blinded by the movement of time
Confined to the roots of repair

The traveler’s son they come askin’
Where he came from
‘Cause they’ve watched him
Washing his face near the pond
A curious boy and they wonder
Where he came from
He says: “I, I have seen the world’s most beautiful places
Still I feel, as If I’m a walking machine
Watching it all through a screen
There is nothing in between to me
This might as well not be real”
Imagine, the girls take him up on a hill
It’s an Indigo night, there’s a chill
The boy is confused but he’s still
As they gather around him
So many of them, they all sing
About the pleasures of life
And he cries: ""Why can’t I sing along with some feeling, or some meaning?
It feels like I’ve always been blind
I don’t know why you girls are so kind
For there are so many in line
Whose lives aren’t as lost as mine”

Now something happened there
The smell of the grass, or maybe the air
There was no more despair
Just something about that night
Maybe the girls, they lit some light
And made everything right
‘Cause he’s never been
More alive"

Lying on the bathroom floor naked
Hiding coke inside all your orange Pixy Stix
You take a rail & spread it on your tit

You've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to you except me
I've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to me except you

Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago
Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago

There's a small black notebook that you keep hidden underneath your bed
I've seen before
It says every dirty thing that you did with every single boy
You've ever been with

You've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to you except me
I've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to me except you

And we fall asleep to the scent
Sleep to the scent of long stemmed roses
Always dreaming of sex
Dreaming of sex on the ceiling
And we sleep to the scent
Sleep to the scent of long stemmed roses
Always dreaming of sex
Dreaming of sex on the ceiling

Well one-time, friends, I had a ma, I even had a pa
He beat her with a belt once 'cause she cried
She told him to take care of me, she headed down to Tennessee
Well, it's easier than just waitin' around to die

Then I came of age and I found a girl in a Tuscaloosa bar
She cleaned me out and she hit in on the sly
Well I tried to kill the pain, I bought some wine, I hopped a train
Well, it's easier than just waitin' around to die

Then a friend said he knew, where some easy money was
We robbed a man and brother, did we fly
But the posse caught up with me, and he drag me back to Muskogee
And now it's two long years, waitin' around to die

Now I'm out of prison and I got me a friend at last
And he don't steal or cheat or drink or lie
Well, his name is Codeine, he's the nicest thing I've seen
And together we're gonna wait around to die"

Jis palieka mane ir mūsų vaikus

Kai gyvenimo tiek prisvajoja, jog gyvent nebesinori

Nežinau kas toliau
Aš tik vieno prašau - Dieve, mylėk jį
Galbūt viskas pasisuko kiek keistoku kampu

Ir kai tu išeini, taip savotiškai gera

Constant growing up

I’m not making this up
It got hard for me to believe in true love
Constant growing up

Yeah, I’m not running away…

Wouldn’t be telling the truth
If I don’t admit that I depend on you
Constant growing up

The difference between night and day
We watch the moon rise and all that indicates
I got a home in you that noon illuminates together, alone in you
I’m not running away

You got to carry me

How it swells in size
And is it the carnival
Can you hear all the songs they play
Turning the night into the day
You're lost in the atmosphere
And if you need some part of me
When you're alone there by the sea
I'll sing you this message through the shell
That you press to your cheek

Remember, oh love, it's my longing, makes them shine so bright
Because love has both captured and set us free

Not long ago I heard a song
Reminded me of how we lost our senses
The days were short, the nights were long
Wrong was nice, we sabotaged our chances

We lost control so easily
We fell in love to disagree
Locked the door and threw away the key

'Cause we were foolish
Such a shame we couldn't see
We were foolish
Playing heart games just to bleed

All my memories are clouded by
Salty rivers, I don't cry, I'm tearless
I hide behind my entourage
Every day they tell me I am fearless

But when I close the door and I'm alone
The walls are closing in on me
It takes loneliness to see

That we were foolish
Such a shame we couldn't see
We were foolish
Playing heart games just to bleed

You are on your knees, you are naggin' me, for sure
But we can go back to where the foolish people go
Now I'm on my knees, and I'm naggin' you, for sure
I can't go back, oh, can we go back?

'Cause we were foolish
Such a shame we couldn't see
We were foolish
Playing heart games just to bleed

We were foolish
Such a shame we couldn't see
We were foolish

Some of them will leave you but
Some of them will stay

Well our hearts keep drumming
And the years keep coming
Quicker than they’ve ever been
You’re sick of the same thing
But it’s quicker than changing
It's too late to begin

Well everybody’s running but
You don’t know where
Time is running thin
Everybody’s looking for somebody to love
But we’re scared to let them in

And I say oh oh oh

Am I here alone?
I say oh oh oh

Am I here alone?
Am I on my own?

It comes and goes
But no one never tells you how to learn to let go

Some of them will hurt you but
Some of them won’t

Well the bridge is burning
And the wheel keeps turning
Quicker than it did before
Your heart screams ""yes""
Your head says ""no""
And you’re never really sure

Well everybody’s running
But you don’t know why
Time is running short
Everybody’s looking for a place to hide
So there’s no one left at all

If this is redemption, why do I bother at all
There's nothing to mention, and nothing has changed
Still I'd rather be working at something, than praying for the rain
So I wander on, 'til someone else is saved
I moved to the coast, under a mountain
Swam in the ocean, slept on my own
At dawn I would watch the sun cut ribbons through the bay
I'd remember all the things my mother wrote

That we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
Never once has any man I've met been able to love
So if I were you, I'd have a little trust

Two thousand years, I've been in that water
Two thousand years, sunk like a stone
Desperately reaching for nets
That the fishermen have thrown
Trying to find, a little bit of hope
Me I was holding, all of my secrets soft and hid
Pages were folded, then there was nothing at all
So if in the future I might need myself a savior
I'll remember what was written on that wall

That we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
Never once has any man I've met been able to love
So if I were you, I'd have a little trust

Am I an honest man, and true?
Have I been good to you at all?
Oh, I'm so tired of playing these games
We'd just be running down
The same old lines, the same old stories of
Breathless trains and worn down glories
Houses burning, worlds that turn on their own

So we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
Never once has any man I've met been able to love
So if I were you my friend, I'd learn to have just a little bit of trust"

When you only got 6 cars?""

Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard

This is a waltz
Thinking about our bodies
What they mean
For our salvation
With only the clothes
That we stand up in
Just the ground
On which we stand
Is the darkness
Ours to take?
Bathed in lightness
Bathed in heat

All is well
As long as we keep spinning
Here and now
Dancing behind a wall
Hear the old songs
And laughter within
All forgiven
Always and never been true

When I arrive
Will you come and find me?
Or in a crowd
Be one of them?
Mother wants us
Back beside her
No tomorrows
At peace"

In a great big haunted house
Just stumbling around in the darkness
Can't seem to get to sleep at night
Because of the lies, lies, lies

Sometimes it’s hard for us to find the truth
In a world we no longer seem to understand
But don’t let them break us and don’t let them nail us
Into boxes for the old man’s parade

Coming in from the cold, to settle an old score

Hurtful
And it's true I always wanted love to be
Filled with pain

Screamed, ""I just completely love you

Watch, I'll even cut off my finger
It'll grow back like a starfish

And he, checking time, did punch me
And I sighed and bleeded like a windfall
Happy bleedy, happy bruisy
I am very happy
So please hit me
I am very, very happy
So please hurt me

Searching for a thrill
Smiles on happy pills

Something has changed in me
And here I go
On the road again
Seeking another storm
Just when I think I’ve got it right
I hear the laughter of life
Something has changed

How many times we’ve pledged forever
Gone overnight like the weather
Magic days of childhood I took for granted
Now I see were held together by a thread

Something has changed in me
Changed again
Something has changed in me
And here I am
On the run again
Seeking another storm
Just when I think I’ve got it right

How many times can a person begin again?
The road getting stranger with every turn
Nature flaunting her beauty and indifference
Smears away our love with a smile

For this beautiful delusion
That is robbing me blind

That I'm feeling this way
With plenty to think about
And so little to say
Except for this confession
That is poised on my lips
I'm not letting go of God
I'm just losing my grip
I want to know
I want to know
Will it keep you guessing
When I go

What is a love
If the love's not my own
This is not my home
This is lonely
But never alone
I just want to hold you
In my gaze for awhile
So I can remember
Every line around your smile
Then I want to know
I want to know
Will it make a difference

There's nothing to give
Well, how can we ask for more?

As you tremble in the darkness

As you search for your answer
And no answer has been found
May you stand, stand your ground

And when you come to the table
To lay your burdens down
As you wait upon the weary
For whom no rest was found
As you search for to lean on
And find no friend around
May you stand, stand your ground

And may you stand, stand your ground
May you stand, stand your ground

And you feel like falling down
May you stand, stand your ground

And as you kneel in the garden
And no one is around
As you raise your hands above you
And from your lips cry out
Oh Father forgive me
For I could not see through my doubt
May you stand, stand your ground

And may you stand, stand your ground
May you stand, stand your ground
When the last step is before you
And your light is burning out

Deep in the ocean, dead and cast away
Where innocence is burned in flames
A million miles from home, I'm walking ahead
I'm frozen to the bones, I am
A soldier on my own, I don't know the way
I'm riding up the heights of shame
I'm waiting for the call, the hand on the chest
I'm ready for the fight and fate

The sound of iron shots is stuck in my head
The thunder of the drums dictates
The rhythm of the falls the number of deaths
The rising of the horns ahead
From the dawn of time to the end of days
I will have to run away
I want to feel the pain, and the bitter taste
Of the blood on my lips again

This deadly burst of snow is burning my hands
I'm frozen to the bones, I am
A million miles from home, I'm walking away
I can't re-call your eyes, your face"

Yeah, ey

Mitternacht, Raubzug, raus Richtung Aufzug
Cops steh'n im Weg, boom, Schmauchspur'n im Hausflur (Pew)
Beute unterm Polohemd, ich hab' für mein Brot gekämpft
Deine Hoe geht fremd und macht Go-go-Dance auf OnlyFans (Ja)
Fick' auf euer Modetrends, fick' drauf, welche Roli glänzt
Aus dem Weg, hier kommt Prominenz aus dem Orient (Yeah)
Persischer Killer, hol' im Turban das Fulus
Nein, ich schlachte nicht nur an Kurban Haroufs (Nein)
Kann sein, ich komm' morgen in Haps
Doch ich ertränke niemals meine Sorgen in Schnaps
Ein Gebet wird in Worte gefasst gegen Zorn und den Hass
Meine Seele wie von Dornen zerkratzt (Ey)
Sitz' vor Gericht und sag' zum Richter: „Bleib ma' chillig, Bruder
Ich hab' diesen Scheiß nicht fabriziert, das war mein Zwillingsbruder“
Hör ma' zu, du Wichtigtuer
Deine Bitch parkt ihren Mini-Cooper vor mein Haus und hängt mit mir im Swimming-Pool, ah

God bless, immer top dressed
Schnippe meine Kippe auf ihn, wenn der Cop stresst
Puste durch den Dreck, doch bin immer noch fresh
Dropp' Cash für die Family und bleibe God blessed
Yeah, ich bin God blessed, immer top dressed
Schnippe meine Kippe auf ihn, wenn der Cop stresst
Kette VVS, Monster-Drip, Loch Ness
Dropp' Cash für die Family und bleibe God blessed

Als ich anfing mit Tracks, war das kein Goethe-Niveau
Ja, ich habe „Bubble Butt“ gemacht wie ein Schönheitschirurg
Heut bin ich ein reifer Mann mit 'nem Börsendepot
Stabiler aufgestellt als 'ne Römerlegion (Yeah)
Alte Manager war'n ehrenlos, sie reden bloß am Telefon
War'n seelentot und mussten sich Schläge holen wie Metronom'n
Alles Hunde mit gespaltener Zunge
Heut hab' ich GmbHs und streu' euch Salz in die Wunde
Jetzt seid ihr aufgewacht, ihr Tagträumer
Trug die Nase hoch wie Koksdealer in Parkhäusern
Meine TAG Heuer, ist ein Timepiece
Zeig mir nicht die Zeit, Bitch, zeig mir, dass ich reich bin
Mich zu brechen hat noch keiner geschafft
Ich hab' aus eigener Kraft immer weiter gemacht
Egal, wie abgefuckt es war, aus dem Schatten in die Charts
Papa war nicht da, aber dafür Mama und Allah

God bless, immer top dressed
Schnippe meine Kippe auf ihn, wenn der Cop stresst
Puste durch den Dreck, doch bin immer noch fresh
Dropp' Cash für die Family und bleibe God blessed

So I have this dream, it comes like twice in a week
It’s been so for years and years on repeat
And since then I’ve not had a full night of sleep
'Cause it plays out the same way
I live with this girl and our kid
I’m as happy as a pig rolled in shit
It’s postcard, I’m settled, a pirate no more
A gypsy at most with no mortgage
It’s boring but in the most exquisite of ways
No carcinogenic and humdrum malaise
And it’s strange, all the things that I’ve run from
Are the things that completeness could come from

So anyways, we’re happy and impossibly so
It’s earth and it’s heaven, all simpatico
Floorboards laid out and the walls painted white
My dream self and I like the same things
They’re all set to leave and I kiss them goodbye
They go and get groceries or something and I
Am drinking alone in the basement
And pray I’m not hallucinating

Do not let this thing you got go to waste
Do not let your heart be dismayed
It’s here by some random disclosure of grace
From some vascular, great thing
Let your life grow strong and sweet to the taste
'Cause the odds are completely insane
Do not let your spirit wane
Do not let your spirit wane
No, no, no, no, no, no

In love, I am careful to mostly reserved
And this dream is a life I don’t think I deserve
My girl and our kid are impossibly bright
And I am just drunk in my basement
See a car, see my girl and look at our kid
Approaching a corner, with rain and a skid
Then a phone call to me from the ICU ward
""Sir, I’m so sorry to say this""
I’m walking alone through the hospital door
ID their bodies, collapse to the floor
Numb and relentlessly broken
Then I wake up the very next moment

Do not let this thing you got go to waste
Do not let your heart be dismayed
It’s here by some random disclosure of grace
From some vascular, great thing
Do not let this thing you got go to waste
The pain and the beauty, so strange
Do not let your spirit wane
Do not let your spirit wane

Cut me out, take me home
My hands are tired, my legs are broke
And the ruptured chrome plus the deep unknown
Turn my insides out and my head face down
Cut me out, take me home
My hands are tired, my legs are broke
And the ruptured chrome plus the deep unknown
Turn my insides out and my head face down

Do not let this thing you got go to waste
Do not let your heart be dismayed
It’s here by some random disclosure of grace
From some vascular, great thing
Get the fuck out of your head if it says
“Stay cold and be deathly afraid”
Do not let your spirit wane
Do not let your spirit wane"

From the show that starts the moment things were fine
I'm over the overexposure
And I coulda told you but I'm better off just lying

My lover's got humour
She's  the giggle at a funeral
Knows  everybody's disapproval
They should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's  the last true mouthpiece
Every  Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We  were born sick"", you heard them say it
Command me to be well

Amen, amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll  worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get somethin' shiny
Somethin' meaty for the main course
That's a fine-lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

No Masters or Kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

How many times must a girls heart break
Before she finally learns?
That every single word they say is fake
And when they leave it burns
I've got nothing left so you can take it
Promise me you'll tell me when you're done
But if you find some hope you better break it
'Cause baby, I don't like what I've become

I don't like the silence sleeping in between us
I don't like the feeling when you make me jealous
I don't like the weakness, I don't like to lie
Hate the way you close down everytime I cry
Every time I wanna talk you make it so impossible
Even when I'm innocent you're holding me responsible
Strip another piece of me, take away my dignity
Never show me sympathy and maybe I will learn
Maybe I will learn

How many fires must a girl walk through
Before it finally rains?
Will she wake up on the other side
Once the water drains?
Tell me all this fighting has a meaning
'Cause I can't find the point of what we've done
If you care enough you better leave me
'Cause baby I don't like what I've become

I write in cursive lines
And I need the help
I miss the shelter of knowing
Nothing else

And I will never be
I will never be myself
I will never be
I will never be too well

I'd walk the corners
Of my empty mind
But I'm full of darkness
With the loneliest of light

And I will never be
I will never be myself

I will never be too well

And we'll be fine, there is an end
It hurts to fall back again
And we'll be fine, I promise, oh

Well, she wore you like silk
Bandaged all around
The scars of your love
Became your hollow crown
And she held you through the night
And kissed you through the cold
Blinded by your light
Just waiting to grow old

She said, love, I'd give you everything
I'd give you everything that you need
Oh, love, well I'd do anything
And I'd do anything to be seen

So when you packed all of your bags
And left without a word
Well, the voices in her head
Were begging to be heard
So she wept all through the night
And slept all through the day
'Cause her lonely, lonely heart
Was caught in every trap you laid

And she said, love, I'd give you everything
I'd give you everything that you need
Oh, love, well I'd do anything
Yes, I'd do anything to be seen

Why did we break down?
Why did we break down?
Was it just
'Cause we weren't ready?
Why did we break down?
Why did we break down?
Was I vulnerable, or too unsteady?
And why did we break down?
And why did we break down?
Was it just
'Cause we weren't ready?
And why did we break down?
And why did we break down?
Was I too vulnerable, or too unsteady?

Oh, love, I gave you everything

Oh, love, well I'd do anything
Yes, I'd do anything

Something disturbed my sleep
Out through an open window came

It happened just the other day
When through the open balcony door

Carrying me home again
Back to making love at dawn
Back to singing these love songs
So pour me another drink
Let us watch the hours pass
Did I ask him for too much?
I can't recall my lover's touch

The police met the plane
They let you finish your meal
I know you'd like to believe it, baby
But you're more kid than criminal
Just a boy who could not
Get through a domestic flight
Without lighting up in the restroom
Got caught, cloud of smoke, thumb still on the light
You looked so proud
Couldn't wait to call a friend
We had to fly back home
Never got the money back for that weekend
Right there on the Sydney tarmac
I threw my luggage down
I said, ""I'm gonna leave you
I'm not a good woman when you're around""
That's when the sound came in
I could finally see
I felt the changing of the seasons
All of my senses rushing back to me
Go your own way
Watch me turn my own head
Eyes on the driver, hands in my lap
Heading to the city to get my body back

I remembered early days
When you took my camera
Turned to me, twenty-three
Naked on your bed, looking straight at you
Do you still have that photograph?
Would you use it to hurt me?
Well, I guess it's just my life
And it's just my body

I guess it's just my life
And it's just my body

You can't remain the prey
You have to become an equal

So look in the mirror and tell me, who do you see?
Is it still you? Or is it me?

Become the beast, we don't have to hide
Do I terrify you or do you feel alive?
Do you feel the hunger? Does it howl inside?
Does it terrify you? Or do you feel alive?

And burrow within

And burrow within

So embrace the darkness (Embrace the darkness)
And I will help you see (I will help you see)
That you can be limitless and fearless
If you follow with me

We are the lions
In a world of lambs
We are the predators, the hunters, the hunters

Become the beast, we don't have to hide
Do I terrify you or do you feel alive?
Do you feel the hunger? Does it howl inside?
Does it terrify you? Or do you feel alive?

The traveler’s son they come askin’
Where he came from
‘Cause they’ve watched him
Washing his face near the pond
A curious boy and they wonder
Where he came from
He says: ""'I, I have seen the world’s most beautiful places
Still I feel, as If I’m a walking machine
Watching it all through a screen
There is nothing in between
To me
This might as well not be real""
Imagine, the girls take him up on a hill
It’s an Indigo night, there’s a chill
The boy is confused but he’s still
As they gather around him
So many of them, they all sing
About the pleasures of life
And he cries: ""Why can’t I sing along with some feeling, or some meaning?
It feels like I’ve always been blind
I don’t know why you girls are so kind
For there are so many in line
Whose lives aren’t as lost as mine”


Now something happened there
The smell of the grass, or maybe the air
There was no more despair
Just something about that night
Maybe the girls, they lit some light
And made everything right
‘Cause he’s never been
More alive"

Feel his grace slowly running out
Give me truth
Give me away out

And you're scared of us 'cause we show you love

Just to leave that life behind
And in the darkness, dreams around us
I could hear that spirit cry
In the garden, burning flowers
Goldenseal, a deadly night
And in the smoke rings I sense violence
That conceals all that was right
Out across that plane
I'm not going there to stay
It's just how, how it seems
I’m afraid of the world in between of what we don’t see
So let your eyes rest on the yellow
You may find yourself at ease
And if that demon of love won’t let you go
Just lie down and be received

And so we’ll finally emancipate
Away from all our weakness

The day that we’ll be made of iron veins
We will remember of what our pain is made
And so we’ll finally emancipate

So we resign to live through love
Or own a bit of soil from this earth
And wish for the better tomorrow

These burning aches in my heart
They’re tearing me all apart

And build a land without sorrow

Sailed around its ring
I wrought myself a country
And I crowned myself it’s king
I made myself religion
Carved christ in ivory
I deemed an airtight Sunday
To justify myself all the bleeding
I clawed myself a nation
And I’ve shopped its waterways
I crack the dirt for smoking out
Rhymes of energy
I gouge myself a pipeline
I dig myself a mine
I take myself a forest
To sap the growing up of your shrine
I’ve halted ghosts from dancing
Swept the prayers from the last ones left
And I kept the drums from breathing
It’s I that warped the blankets’ web
I that warp the blankets web

To speak in some such candor
I rip from the condor’s wing
I feed on loving bodies
And take the land from them to stanch their living
Take the land from them to stanch the living"

So I became the king

And I wrote a song
About all things I need
Will I have a house?
Will I be a star?
What would people think
If I didn't make it far?

S'en promettent et s'en mettent plein les mirettes
Pour moi le bout du monde s'appelle ""après demain""
Petit horizon, pour d'obscures raisons, je ne vois pas plus loin
Mon cœur regarde en lui s'il s'étire en longueur
Je me ferme devant ceux
Ceux qui m'ouvrent leur cœur
Non, pas que ça m'amuse, non ça ne m'amuse pas
Je crois à la passion mais sans explications, je reviens sur mes pas

Alors je suis fier, si fier, si fier qu'on ait pu traverser l'hiver

Oh ça me plait, ça me plait, ça me plait, ça me désespère
Fier et perdu à la fois

Quand les autres en amour s'imaginent
Inventeurs précurseurs de la discipline
Je suis accrédité à la médiocrité
Autant passer mon tour j'avais et j'ai toujours d'autres priorités
Et qu'on me tienne la main et je suis prisonnier
Qu'on me parle tout bas
Et je regarde en l'air
Moi je me fous comme il faut du langage amoureux
Car j'en refuse les closes
Comme d'avoir sur les choses un seul avis pour deux

Alors je suis fier, si fier, si fier qu'on ait pu traverser l'hiver

Oh ça me plait, ça me plait ça me plait, ça me désespère

Parlementent, argumentent et se mentent

With another one for the caves
And in the tarn beyond those birches
There's a spirit that I crave
And from the island, people watched you
You set that viking ship ablaze
We reached the moon, fall's icy cauldron
And found the spirit that I crave

All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need

You've fallen barefoot past the treeline
Beaten, bone-eyed, butchered, swayed
A thousand whitefish floating belly up
In the spirit that I crave
And we threw ourselves right into it
Where lay the bodies had been claimed
We dove a third out for the fifth
Banned to the spirit that I crave

All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need

I found empathy from madness
Deliverance from malaise
My heart is is filled with gladness
At the only spirit that I crave

All I need is some sunshine

Everybody knows what you will say

We were an island
You were the one who broke away
I was a mess before you came

We started something
Tried to make a fire without a flame
Why it wasn't right, I couldn't say
Why it wasn't right, I couldn't say
There's a light in the sky and it's coming up high
And why did I ever go?
The longest night I've ever known
The longest night I've ever known

Only when the moon is high enough
Only when the stars are linin' up

Let it go
Now is not the answer
How can anybody else have known?
Let it go
Now is not the answer
Call me when you see the sun lie low

You were the ocean
I was drawn into you
But you can't always get where you are going to
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
There are mountains to climb, so let me carry you

Only when the moon is high enough
Only when the stars are linin' up

Let it go

It was upon a row of houses
Tight skirts and baggy trousers
Green men and cheap disguises
High hopes and higher rises
Who lived a girl who was on a mission
Who lived a boy who was under suspicion
Tried hard to stay beside her
Until the devil put his seed inside her
How? You know how
Sleep too long and the sand runs out
So close to midnight
Time to fly, do or die
Stoned in the headlights

Here we lie, high and dry
The world will never see you 'til you open your eyes
Say goodnight, kill the light
The world will never hear you tonight
Idlewild

For two years, he tried to reach her
Worshipped the ground beneath her
She, she was always runnin'
He, he saw the end was comin'
But now the story takes a turn and
She wakes up and her sheets are burnin'
Head down against the fire
Now, now, now the table turns
She won't learn
Sleep too long and your bed starts burnin'
So close to midnight
Idlewild, you don't know
You never need to

Here we lie, high and dry
The world will never see you 'til you open your eyes
Say goodnight, kill the light
The world will never hear you tonight
Idlewild (Do, do, do, do)
Idlewild (Do, do, do, do)

I thought that we were good together
I thought that we could weather the weather
Whether or not, the why's the word for us
The high hopes are only there because, because
Because I thought the only thing between us
Was somethin' shallow, not a river so deep, we see us
Dredge up the wreckage our parents left us
Lay it on the banks to rot and fester
Now its skeleton hangin' like a Death Star
In Gretna Green, Darby, Manchester
And I don't want to hear it now

Here we lie, high and dry
The world will never see you 'til you open your eyes
Say goodnight, kill the light
The world will never hear you tonight

Take a little look from the outside, if you can
Move over me now, try a little tenderness
A little shabby dress, I wouldn’t care
Only cry for you, cry for you
Might die for you too

I threw my luggage down
I said, ""I'm gonna leave you
I'm not a good woman when you're around""
That's when the sound came in
I could finally see
I felt the changing of the seasons
All of my senses rushing back to me
Go your own way
Watch me turn my own head
Eyes on the driver, hands in my lap
Heading to the city to get my body back

I remembered early days
When you took my camera
Turned to me, twenty-three
Naked on your bed, looking straight at you
Do you still have that photograph?
Would you use it to hurt me?
Well, I guess it's just my life
And it's just my body

I guess it's just my life
And it's just my body
I guess it's just my life
And it's just my body
I guess it's just my life
And it's just my body
I guess it's just my life

Where the light shivers offshore, through the tides of oceans
We are shining in the rising sun
As we are floating in the blue, I am softly watching you
Oh boy, your eyes betray what burns inside you

Whatever I feel for you
You only seem to care about you
Is there any chance you could see me, too?
'Cause I love you
Is there anything I could do
Just to get some attention from you?
In the waves, I've lost every trace of you
Where are you?

After all I drifted ashore, through the streams of oceans
Whispers wasted in the sand
As we were dancing in the blue, I was synchronized with you
But now the sound of love is out of tune

Whatever I feel for you
You only seem to care about you
Is there any chance you could see me, too?
'Cause I love you
Is there anything I could do
Just to get some attention from you?
In the waves, I've lost every trace of you
Where are you?

Le ventre vide
Rien dans les poches
Pas un rond pour acheter le succès mérité
Combien m'ont tendu la main, pas un proche
Artiste aigrie
En perte de vitesse-sse-sse
Avide de gloire, de reconnaissance
Ils m'ont fait perdre mon adolescence
D’après mon père je vendrais mon uc’
Je ferais la pute dans le coin d'une rue
Maman était là et le grand frère aussi
Tout l’monde était là mais personne n'a rien dit
De maison de disque en maison close
Toujours les mêmes parties de fesses

Je bouge mon boulard pour renflouer leur caisse-caisse-caisse

Des liasses de regrets
Vivre à crédit pour éponger mes dettes
Serrer les dents pour que tout ça s'arrête
Je m'voyais déjà en haut de l'affiche
La réalité me rattrape au réveil
La réalité me chuchote au réveil
Au petit matin j'ai quitté le nid
Pris mon envol petit à petit
J'suis tombée cent fois et j'ai su me relever
Devant le miroir j'ai su me retrouver
Devant le miroir je me suis retrouvée
Devant le miroir je me suis retrouvée

When you come dead last
In battles long past
Intended to rip my heart out
Oracle of your secrets
Your eye was trained on me
As I stood before you, unbuttoning
Kiss me as the bell tolls
Swiftly, as the horses ride

Won't you dance?
Won't you dance?
Won't you dance?
Won't you dance?

Damn my dreams, the tormentors
Last night your mouth was on my skin
And the poppies were like fire on the mountain
I took your hand and led you home
All my old ways have started kickin' in
And my bad days are comin' round again
Left here in American darkness
River on fire and sun eclipsed

Won't you dance?
Won't you dance?
Won't you dance?
Won't you dance?

'Cause I'm comin'
'Cause I'm comin'
'Cause I'm comin'
'Cause I'm comin'

When you come
When you come back to me"

And through the love comes a mirror

Covered in dust
The wings of my porcelain dove
They don't trouble the waters my love
Frozen in time
Fragile to touch
She melts like the words on my tongue
The goddess of heavenly love
Fades out of sight

All your stars are in view
I get lost loving you (Flame)

Dark was the night
Her shape burned a void in my eyes
It was black but so violently bright
Like the birth of a sun
So I cried out
But my voice could not be heard aloud
For held here safe in my mouth
The bird was done

All your stars are in view
I get lost loving you"

He's always in three places
Spaces undefined
Heart is always racin'
For something he will never find
Eyes are black
Black and cold
His soul has been shaken
So shaken
I believe he knows
The sun could never reach him
The view looks like a bomb
The paradox is far away
His brain weighs at least a ton
His mind is so stressed out
Tryin' to be a king
When everyone around him
Sees the clown and
They're laughing at him
Look at this idiot
Don't know he's been set up to fall
Can't find the truth in any friend
And all he ever does is want drugs

This world is drunk
And the people are mad
This world is drunk
And the people are mad
This world is drunk, ooh
This world is drunk and
This world is drunk and the people are mad

He doesn't get a listen
Not even to himself
He spent 4 years away
Was led astray
Convicted for fraud
He said he knows more now
Now that he returned
The books that he read there
Told him he had gone too far
He's always feeling left out
And he always left his friends out
He never understood why
That most of his friends are just bums
He's tryna live better now
He says he needs that family life
He can tell he wasted much time
Winter time has taken his life
And making him miserable
He never feels he's in control
He finds it hard to walk away
So all he ever does is stay drunk

This world is drunk
And the people are mad
So mad
This world is drunk
And the people are mad
So mad
This world is drunk, ooh
This world is drunk
So drunk
This world is drunk
And the people are mad

And the people are mad
So, so very, so very

You know you'll join 'em up in heaven
But if you stay with me, no hurry
I will make it worth it

And you won't get away with it

Why can’t I just keep it simple

And kill the poison

Why do I deserve the science?
To feel better about You?
At a loss, I lost my cool
I denied that I found You
I tried to be a basket case
I did not surprise You
I'm trying to find a signal fire
Let me know when I should move

But You, amplified in the silence
Justified in the way You make me bruise
Magnified in the science
Anatomically proved that You don't need me
(There is nothing You keep, there is only Your reflection)
(There is nothing You keep, there is only Your reflection)

Why do I desire the space?
I was mourning after You
I was lost and lost my shape
There was nothing I could do
I don't want to waste away
It was all I gave to You
Take me back and take my place
I will rise right up for You

But You, amplified in the silence
Justified in the way You make me bruise
Magnified in the science
Anatomically proved that You don't need me

All the while you waste away, you're asking
""Did I really need another one to take me down?""
Everybody knows it's something that you had to live with, darling
Nobody's gonna tear you down now
There is nothing You keep, there is only Your reflection
(There is nothing You keep, there is only Your reflection)

There was nothing but quiet retractions
And families pleading, ""Don't look in that cabinet
There's far more bad than there's good, I don't know how it got there""
That was something your father had burned in me
Twenty hours out of Homestake eternity
""You can go anywhere but you are where you came from""
Little girl, you are cursed by my ancestry
There is nothing but darkness and agony
I can not only see, but you stopped me from blinking
Let me watch you as close as a memory
Let me hold you above all the misery
Let me open my eyes and be glad that I got here
There is nothing You keep, there is only Your reflection"

Et comme on avait pris la route à deux

Les mauvais jours, moi je m'en passe

Nombreux sont ceux qui dansent près de moi

La route sera pleine de crises
Les hauts les bas, ça nous passera

Dangereuses et brûlantes pour nous, ouh

Here we are again, hanging by a thread
The truth is almost gone
There's no more love to save, you always got your way

You said to give you space and time, but was it all a lie?
Just a way to hold me down?
Now the water's flooding in, and you come back again
But can't you see I'm drowning?

Keep my head low
Decide on it once and for all
So now you know
They say it's impossible to grow, but I've grown
Read the headstone
Confide in it once and for all

Leave me to my own devices
It's better when your coca-cola eyes are out of my face
I checked your phone and no surprises
She's grinning from ear to ear in purple lace

So take your orchids
Elsewhere, elsewhere
I loved you to death
But now I don't really care
'Cause you're running 'round over there
Yeah, you're running 'round over there
And now I don't really care
'Cause you're running 'round over there
And now I don't really care
'Cause you're running 'round over there

I'll miss your t-shirt in the rain
The one that makes you look like Gerard Way
Eating grapes in the back of the party
Throwing hands 'cause she drank your Bacardi
I know it's kinda dumb but I'll miss the way you dressed all punk
With the black and the studs and the ripped up clothes
Bet she loved your tough guy front

So take your orchids
Elsewhere, elsewhere
I loved you to death
And now I don't really care
'Cause you're running 'round over there
Yeah, you're running 'round over there
And now I don't really care

We spoke of was and when
Although I was not there
He said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes, ""I thought you died alone
A long long time ago""

Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
At all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long long time ago

Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Oh no, not me

Ooh-ooh-ah, ooh-ooh-ah

Broken sleep, all too human
A malady
It's gazing through when I

(Dream me a dream soft as a pillow)
(Dream me a dream)
(Deep in the night 'til the morning will follow)
Dream me a dream
(Dream me a dream)
Dream me a dream
(Dream me a dream)
Dream me a dream

Shapes of smoke, all too human
They grow like titans

I would like to fall, silence every call
(Will you level me with a dream?)
If I will (Fall) fall, fall
I would like to fall (Fall asleep)
Silence every call (Will you level me with a dream?)
If I will (Fall), I will fall

Twisted rope defies all I know (Ooh)
It holds my reason

(Dream me a dream soft as a pillow)
I will (Dream me a dream)
Dream me a dream
(Deep in the night 'til the morning will follow)
I will (Dream me a dream)
Dream me a dream

Sea of trees calling humans
Hang like leaves from the willow

I would like to fall, silence every call
(Will you level me with a dream?)
If I will (Fall) fall, fall
I would like to fall (Fall asleep)
Silence every call (Will you level me with a dream?)
If I will (Fall), I will fall

Take my word for it
Ooh, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, words can follow"

I realized
Everything i see
Is temporary
I felt the honesty
I felt the mistery
It's all temporary
And it fills a void
With a sense of wonder
Makes it easier to love
Easier to make mistakes
There's a great feeling
That there's no longer anything at stake
When it's all temporary
Everything out here
Is made of the possibility
To dissapear
No ordinary people
No ordinary moments
From the day you see
It's all temporary
You stop looking for love
Start looking the barriers
The barriers you hold
To keep love from coming
Touch everything you see
Very very lightly
'cause it's temporary

Everything out here
Is made of the possibility
To dissapear
There's no ordinary people
No ordinary moments
From the day you see
It's all temporary
It's all temporary
Everything I see
Is temporary"

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

But now it isn't true
Now, everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me...

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion

There was fire around us, so I should have known why
The touch of his hands were as cold as his eyes
So don't you tell me we weren't hypnotised
Woah-oh, oh, woah-oh

The print was so small, I didn't understand
He cut our thumbs and placed a feather in our hands
Told us we would see all our dreams and plans unfold
Oh, woah-oh

Our hearts we have sold for diamonds and gold
But hey, baby, take a look, we have it all

All my life I've been heading for hell
But never had I thought I'd drag you down as well
I just couldn't resist what he was trying to sell
Oh, woah-oh

There's glory ahead, but our love will be forgotten
If my heart was still mine, I would go to the bottom
And apologise to you until the day it went rotten
Woah-oh, oh, woah-oh

But haven't you heard? Hearts turn to dirt
Along with the rest of your body, it's all claimed by the earth
It will fade and it will wither, but gold, it will never
And hey, baby, don't you know diamonds are forever
