I had to go to one of my friends and talk to him
And I told him, I said, ""You know
I'm having problems with the woman that I love
It seems that I call her on the phone and I
I just can't get her to answer
And then I went to her house and I saw a car parked in the driveway
I knocked on the door, but still my knocks went unanswered
And then I went home and I
I watched television until television went off
And then I played my records until I just didn't want to hear them
Anymore and finally I went to bed
But I found myself waking up a few hours later
And the tears were running down my face"" And my friend told me
He said, ""Lenny, you just oughta forget about her""
But I told my friend, I said
""You know, maybe you've never been in love like I've been in love
And maybe you've never felt the things that I've felt""
But this is what I told my friend
I said, ""You know, sometimes you get lonely
You get lonely
You get lonely""
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh and I cry

Would fill up
In the wells
In the wells of my eyes, aw, baby
And then it got so bad

'Till one time I thought I'd roll myself up
In a big ol' ball and die
And then I met you, darlin'
And you smiled at me

I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find a love within
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let it go

Some people go around the world for love
But they may never find what they dream of

What you won't do, to do for love
You've tried everything, but you don't give up
In my world, only you
Make me do for love what I would not do

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you, and I can't let go

And though I only want the best, it's true
I can't believe the things I do for you

What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything, but you won't give up
In my world, only you
Make me do for love what I would not do
Make me do for love what I would not do
Make me do for love what I would not do

Less than one minute old
I never thought through love, we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely? Made from love

Isn't she pretty?
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us, He's given life to one
But isn't she lovely? Made from love


Isn't she lovely?
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely, made from love"

Oooh

Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself, ""You're such a lucky guy""
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellows in the world, she belongs to you

But it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

Ooh (Soon)
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country
With two children, maybe three
I tell you I (I, I) can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream, for too real it all seems

But it was just my imagination, once again
Runnin' away with me
Tell you, it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

Ev'ry night on my knees I pray
""Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me""
Or I will surely die, hmm
(Her love is) heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality
She doesn't even know me

(Just my imagination) Once again
Runnin' away with me, oh
Tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

I’ve never met her but I can't forget her
(Just my imagination) Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Runnin' away with me, ooh
Just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
She's never hard to find (Just my imagination)
She's always on my mind (Runnin' away with me)"

To walk a path that sometimes bends

Without you

Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay you for having faith in me?

No matter how hard I try

And you're the kind of girl I've been looking for
Hey, where do you live?
Where do you live?
I'd like to take you home
What do I have to give?
What do I have to give to call you on the phone?
'Cause you're the kind of girl that I adore
And you're the kind of girl I've been looking for
Girl, tell me your name.  (I wanna know your name.)
Just tell me your name
Please tell me your name.  (I wanna know your name.)
Ain't never seen nothing as sweet as you (I wanna know your name.)
Sitting there in that grey dress, pretty little thing
(I wanna know your name.)
'Cause I never believed in love at first sight
But now I know that it's alright
Girl, tell me your name.  (I wanna know your name.)
Please tell me your name
What's your name?  (I wanna know your name.)
You look so good, you look so good.  (I wanna know your name.)
Girl, I ain't never seen nothing like this in my life
(I wanna know your name.)
You just look like something I could settle down with

Let me introduce myself
My name is Little Sonny
I drive a little Volkswagen
I like to go horseback riding
I like all kinds of sweets, cupcakes, currants, and things like that
This is why I can't help from noticing you, just a jazzy, jazzy old babe
Come on, can I have this dance, something as groovy as this?
We've got to dance
Lord have mercy.  Am I holding you too tight?
Oh, I-I'm sorry, I'm sorry, 'scuse me
Ain't gonna get too close
When are you gonna tell me your name?
Please tell me your name
I'm just going to have to grab you and hold you a little closer
'cause I just got to
Lord have mercy
(I wanna know your name.) Girl, tell me your name
Mmmm, hmmm.  (I wanna know your name.)
Just hold me, just squeeze me
(I wanna know your name.)
Girl, tell me your name, you sweet little thing you
(I wanna know your name.) I could love ya, I could love ya
I could love ya all night long, all night long, all night long
Mmmm, hmmm

Listen, what about if you could give me your phone number and
Call you one Saturday afternoon?
Perhaps, we'll go in town, have a bite to eat
And then, maybe we'll go in and take in a little movie
And afterwards, I'll just drop you at the, huh, at the doorstep and
Give you a little kiss
Oh, I just...
So many things that we could do if you just tell me your name
I'm not even married.  Are you married?
Girl, you gotta tell me, tell me, tell me your name
(I wanna know your name.)
Just wait a minute, don't leave out the door.  (I wanna know your name.)
Don't leave me, don't leave me unless you tell
Just tell, just tell me, girl.  (I wanna know your name.)
Just wait a minute, baby"

Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby (Dream about you, baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby (Dream about you, baby)

When you left you took the sun right out of the sky, yes, you did
Wondered why you went away and never told me why
When the sun goes down, the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appears

Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby (Dream about you, baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby (Dream about you, baby)

Loneliness haunting me when I go to bed, honey
Like a character in a book that I have read
When the sun goes down, the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appears
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it

When the sun goes down, the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appears

Hold back the night, turn on the lights

(Hey man, what's happenin'?)
Hey brother, what's going on? Alright
He's got his woman with him
(How's he doing? Is he okay?)
But mine's at home
What time is it...? Damn, almost 12:45
I think Im'ma walk up here and see what's going on, in this discotheque
There's always something going on in there
What becomes of a broken hearted...
Albeit... mm, this looks like the place
Everybody's going in, lemme step on up here, heh

Yeah, she's at home... yeah, she's at home

Yeah right here, right here, where I'm gonna stay

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-wee!

Just until I feel this misery is gone
Movin', kickin', groovin'
Keep the music strong
On and on and on, and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on, and on and on and on...

I'm out here dancing, and still - huh!
I can't erase the things I feel
The tender love we used to share
Seems it like it's no longer there
I, I've got to hide what's killing me inside

I think I'm gonna be alright - ha ha ha
If I can make it through the night, oh Lord
I'll just pretend she's here with me
I'll close my eyes, her face I'll see
(Won't somebody help me?)
I know it's make believe, but it's the only hope for me

And then you know, that it's only you that I love

New York girl, ooh, ooh, ooh
Runnin' pretty, New York City girl
25, 35, hello, baby
New York City girl

You grew up ridin' the subways, running with people
Up in Harlem, down on Broadway
You're no tramp but you're no lady
Talkin' that street talk
You're the heart and soul of New York City

And love
Love is just a passing word
It's the thought that you had
In a taxicab that got left on the curb
When he dropped you off at East 83rd

Oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh)
You're a native New Yorker
You should know the score by now (you should know by now)
You're a native New Yorker
(New York girl, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Music plays, everyone's dancin' closer and closer
Makin' friends and findin' lovers
There you are, lost in the shadows
Searchin' for someone (searchin' for someone)
To set you free from New York City

And, whoa
Where did all those yesterdays go?
When you still believed
Love could really be like a Broadway show
You were the star, when did it close?

Oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh)
You're a native New Yorker
No one opens the door
For a native New Yorker
(Runnin' pretty, New York City girl)

(Ooh, ooh, ooh

Always and forever, each moment with you
Is just like a dream to me that somehow came true
And I know tomorrow will still be the same
'Cause we've got a life of love that won't ever change and

Everyday, love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me, you really care
And we'll share tomorrow, together
I'll always love you forever, forever

There'll always be sunshine when I look at you
It's something I can't explain just the things that you do
And if you get lonely, phone me and take
A second to give to me that magic you make and

Everyday, love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me, you really care
And we'll share tomorrow, together
I'll always love you ever, ever

Loving you, is a thing that I've planned
For a very long time (Always forever love you)
Me with you, you with me, we as one
Love together, for a very long time (Always forever love you)

For awhile, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew
In our eyes, we're alive
Deep inside, we knew our love was true
For awhile, we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night, something right
Would invite us to begin the day

Something happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Something happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had

And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

For awhile, to love each other with all
We would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Oh, baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had
'Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared
This affair would lead our love in two

Something happened along the way
Yesterday was all we had
Something happened along the way

Something happened along the way
Oh, and yesterday was all we had

And, oh, after the love has gone

I'll never find the words, my love
To tell you how I feel, my love

You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again

Only you
Cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you, filled with gratitude and love

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
Make me feel brand new

My love
Whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me
Precious friend
With you, I'll always have a friend
You're someone who I can depend
To walk a path that sometimes bends

Without you
Life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay you for having faith in me?

God bless you

Streaking across the sky
And playing music as we fly

Where we can lose all track of time

Giving it all from within

And it's not that far away

And we need to go there soon
'Cause baby, it's the only way to start

And now is a perfect time
For making love, over and over again

Where love just never ends
Let me hold you, this is how it all begins

And I don't think that you do either, I...

Here's something you should try
Put your heart in your hand
And you'll find love comes easy

Lucky me, lucky you
We are shining bright
We're so right
Together, together
Music plays everywhere
We're a melody, a harmony
Together, together

Fortune smile the day we met
Twining our lives with golden thread
Our love has no reality
We float on clouds of fantasy
We're free

In a world where there is no peace
We found a new belief
Put your heart in your hand
And you'll find love comes easy
If it seems love has passed you by
Here's something you should try
Put your heart in your hand

With music softly playing, her lips were gently saying: ""I love you""
She held me in desperation, I thought it was a revelation
And then she walked out
How could I be so blind, to give up love for the very first time
To be fooled is a hurting pain, to be loved and fooled
Is a crying shame, while I bear the blame as she laughs my name

True  love in disguise
I  can't help myself, Lord, I want her
I'm doing things against my pride
But love has come again
To  what was a lonely man
Should  I
Just forget the joy for which she holds
Ignore  my heart, let my mind take control, and lie
Alone, we're just strangers in dark corners
Two hearts on a lover's heart
Four eyes staring at each other
Desperately  searching inside
Looking for a way to bring joy into their world
Just for one night
After going for days alone with no sleep
Waiting for that opportunity to hide
Lord, we're just strangers
We're just strangers, Lord, in dark corners
In love, looking for a way to bring joy into their world
Just for one night
After going for days alone with no sleep
Waiting for that opportunity to hide

Lord, we're just strangers
We're just two strangers in dark corners
Two hearts beating fast
We're just strangers in dark corners
Trying to make every minute last

Mmm

When I wake up in the morning
After each night that we meet
There's no room for breakfast
And the hunger is for repeat
The times we spend together
Are so few and far between
It tends to make a man forget
What a woman really means
Yeah, yeah, yeah

In the early afternoon
I relax and take a break
That's when my mind is on you
Far away from a hard day's work
Trying hard to make a living
So I won't get caught between
I really get the feeling of
What a woman really means
Yeah, yeah, yeah

(Don't you forget) Don't you forget
(What a woman really means)
(Don't forget) What a woman really means
(What a woman really means)
(Don't forget)
(What a woman really means)

In the twilight of the evening
When the sun is going down
My love for you grows stronger
It's so good when you're around
You have so much love to offer
That the moments in between
Just help me to realise
Hey, what a woman really means
Hey, hey, yeah

(Don't forget) Don't you forget
(What a woman really means)
(And forget) What a woman really means
(What a woman really means)
(Don't forget) Squeezin', touchin' and lovin'

Lately babe, I've been thinkin'
How good it was when you were here
And it ain't the wine that I've been drinkin'

But early this morning when I opened my eyes
That old lonesome feelin' took me by surprise
I guess you meant more than I realized

The love we had stays on my mind (The love we had)
The love we had stays on my mind (Stays on my mind)

And pretty girl, I've been rememberin'
The good times that we used to share
My thoughts of you don't have an ending
And memories of you are everywhere

But why should I tell you? It's not your concern
You win some, you lose some, I've lost and I've learned
It's just that I'm so lonely with no place to turn
And here at the end I'll find

The love we had stays on my mind

Girl, if you were nearer, if you had a mirror
Maybe you could count my tears
And if you were nearer, it would all be clearer
How I wish that you were here
How I wish that you were here
(How I wish that you were here)

And baby girl, I was tired
So I lay down to dream a while
And lately I've been so uninspired
Without the comfort of your smile

But I'm not complaining 'cause that's how it goes
There's always some heartaches in this world I suppose
But you can't imagine, nobody knows
The love

The love we had stays on my mind

So I could take you in my arms

There ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
There ain't nothing like the real thing

I see your picture hangin' on the wall
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame
And I read your letters, you're not here
They don't move me, they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

There ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
There ain't nothing like the real thing

No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
Let's stay together
Together, baby
Together, yeah
Together, oh, together

I've got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware nothing takes the place of your being there

There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing like the real thing, baby

Is it black or is it white?
What color is love?
Is it here or is it there?
Is it really everywhere?
What color is love?
Is it strong like a mountains
Or deep like a fountain?
Is flowing free
And what about me
How can you receive
If you're not a believer
Is it blue like the sky
And does it really reach that high?
What color is love?
Is it near or is it far
Or is it distant like a star?
What color is love?
Does it glow like an ember
And do you remember?

If love doesn't last
Does it live in the past
And heart cannot live
If a heart isn't giving
When it's over
Does it show
Does it leave
An afterglow
And i really want to know
What color is love?"

There's so much trouble in the world today
It can surely bring you down
Seems like another part of life just slips right on the way
Every time you come around
And there's so many many things I wanna say
But words alone won't ease your mind
Sometimes I wish we could fly away
Leave this all behind
And girl we've got to face reality
Hand in hand, day by day
And I'll be strong just as long as you're with me
I'm with you all the way
With you all the way
Just as long as we're in love
Just as long as we're in love
Just as long as we're in love
I know that we'll be alright
Somehow we're gonna face the challenge of the universe
Hand in hand, come what may
If it brings heaven or hell, or something even worse
I'm with you all the way
With you all the way

Just as long as we're in love
We'll be alright (x3)"

Forgive and forget it, that's not what I'll ask you to do
'Cause I want you back, you know, you know I want you back

Killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
To listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

He sang as if he knew me
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me
As if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

For that moonlit pass
That only he would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor
Known only to my heart
Call back my rose
Rose of San Antoine
Lips so sweet and tender
Like petals fallin' apart
Speak once again of my love, my own

Empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose my rose of San Antoine

Empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose my rose of San Antoine
And rose my rose of San Antoine

I have never been so much in love before
What a difference a true love made in my life
So nice, so right

Loving you gave me something new
That I'd never felt, never dreamed of
Something's changed
No, it's not the feeling I had before
Oh-oh-oh, it's much, much more

Love, I never knew that a touch
Could mean so much
What a difference
And when we walk hand-in-hand
I feel so real

Lovers come and then lovers go
That's what folks will say
Don't they know?
They're not there when you love me
Hold me and say you care

And what we have is much more than they could see
(Well, well, well, well, there's so much more now)
What we have is much more than they could see

I used to think about, immature things
You know like, do you love me, do you want me, are you gon' call me like you said you would, is this really your real phone number?
But you know, I'm a man now baby, a grown man
And I came a long way
And experience taught me one thing
Taught me to hold on to my love

Sometimes, I just can't help thinkin' livin' without you baby
See, sometimes, I just can't live cryin' about you baby
I'm not worried 'bout a doggone thing, I'll take anything you bring
Although I love the sunshine, I still like sather rain
'Cause when I'm in my lonely mood, and I just can't be with you
I tried everything to occupy my mind, and there was no substitute

Thinkin' all that life would be, when you are not around
I just could not find my way, I wouldn't even know up from down
But since I've had you in my life, all things can be found
Strong and true baby, all comin' from you ohh you
Chorus:
I call your name girl (whenever I am lonely baby)
I call your name (when I feel the need of love)
I think of you, and it eases the pain
Take away the strain

'Cause I don't worry what my people say, in my life today
Although they try to say you're not the one for me, I love you anyway
'Cause their intentions might be cool, if what they say was true
But there's more to you than they can ever see, and they don't even know you
(Bridge)
(Chorus)
You, I call your name (sometimes, I get lonely babe)
I call your name (I just can't seem to help myself)
I think of you (When I wanted to be alone, so I'll call your, I'll call your name)
I do, you do baby, we do girl
I, I, I love you, you you love me, and and I know
Whoa ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh ohh
I call your name, and it eases the pain
See, I just don't feel all by myself tonight
It seem like someone else is out there, oh thinkin' upon someone else, child
So you will know where I'm comin' from
Ohh when I'm lonely, when I'm discouraged, I'll, I'll call your name baby
There is, no substitute, no one could take your place
No more than they can ever see
That's why I call your name
Oh baby, when I am lonely
When I am discouraged
I call your name girl
I think of you, and it eases the pain, take away the strain

But now I feel I got a chance to kind of make things up to you a little bit

Hmm, he ever ask about me?
Just a little bit?
Does he still like to go down by the supermarket?

How you doin'?
I'm glad you came by
Now I've been sitting here and hoping and praying that you show
I just couldn't believe that you'd come
Oh, you know, after all I'd put you through
You know, it seems like we always meet on the same grounds
You're always waiting to take me back
Me sitting here with nowhere to go, but you know I've made it now
You know, it took me a long time to realise that you were the only one who wanted me to make it
That meant a lot to me
Come here baby, come on
Let me hold your hand
Don't be afraid, come on baby
'Cause I ain't never gonna leave you again, no baby
'Cause you know what?
I choose you, baby
Yes, i choose you

(I, I choose you, baby)
I, I choose you (Baby)
And I'll tell you why
You were there when no one else would be in my corner
Girl and it's you that I've learned to love
That I've placed no one above
Oh, how can I thank you?
Just take you home and make you my loving wife
So we can always be together, oh ain't that nice?
And I, I choose you (Baby)
Hey, baby, yeah
And ooh, I choose you (Baby)

No longer do I have to shop around anymore
I've found the once in a lifetime girl that I've been searching for
And oh, baby, you're all right
Hopping out the picture, girl, that you're truly out of sight
You're the kind of woman any man would be proud to know
You're the kind of woman a man brags about everywhere he goes

I, I choose you (Baby)
Now, ooh, I choose you (Baby)
'Cause you're sugar, oh, you're spice
Woman, Lord knows, yeah, you're everything nice
Lovin' goodness, oh I, I feel, I feel real nice
And oh, I choose you (baby)
Hey, hey, ain't never gonna leave you
Oh honey, you know, you're staying with me
When nobody else believed I'd ever make it
Ah, yeah, you gave me that inspiration
Every time I was down you picked me up
That's why I choose you, baby
I ain't never, never, never
Never, never, never
Never gonna leave you, baby
Never, never, never
Yeah, honey, never gonna leave you, no, no, no

You know, honey, you taught me what it means to love someone
I, I want you to go places with me, you know?
Meet my friends and family

Say it, say it, baby
No, don’t go away

My Honey Brown, lovely barefooted clown
As sweet and wild as honeysuckle vine
Now children would follow every place you would go
Thrill and delight to your one-woman show

How foolish and vain to think that I could change
A girl whose heart was born for the stage

Honey Brown, we were worlds apart
I knew it from the start
That's why I stepped aside and let you go free
Cause Honey Brown, my love was so deep

I used to laugh at your movie magazines
You vowed one day, you'd be on the screen
I'd fight in the streets when folks tried to say
You'd love any man who promised you fame

And then he came in his big shiny car
Took your love from me and broke my heart

Honey Brown, through your tears, you're gonna find
Life can be cruel and so unkind
So Honey Brown, don't let his masquerade
Make a street corner, a street corner your stage

Oh, don't let him do it
Don't let him do it
Oh, Honey

How foolish and vain to think that I could change
A girl whose heart was born for the stage

Honey Brown, girl can't you see
I'll always love you and want you here with me
Honey Brown, I'll be around
You're gonna need me when the tears come down

Searching in the darkness for a piece of me

I can feel this for sure

I've been here before

I used to be a queen you know, on an island by the sea
With rainbow colored
People, happy as can be

And

Stars to me are
The children, babies are my friends
God is like a galaxy, within my spirit
Flies
Felt this way a million times, please don't ask me why

The question of my lifetime; if you ask my point of view
They say it all was Karma, call it déjà vu

And you can't give love the time
If anger if your friend
Don't know when you die you'll come back again
And in the master's plan
You'll come back woman or man
If your life is
Full of sin
Don't you know when you die you'll come back again

I am not coming back no more

Oh, but one day as I went along I didn't hear his song
But I know the sparrow should sing
Sing on such a morning in spring
Oh sparrow, why don't you sing?
Sing to me, oh, sparrow come around
Come around, why don't you come around?
Sing about melody, aww, melody
About the things you see
Anything you want to sing about
Just sing it on out now, sing it on out
Let the world know what life's all about
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Oh sing, little sparrow, won't you sing for me?
And for the rest of all my world
They'll appreciate it, I know
Every time I'm feeling low
I know I can always count on you
Sing, little sparrow
About the troubles you're in, places you've been
You can sing I know it, don't you try to pretend

Sing while you're here, sing a song, my dear
Let me hear your song, do you mean to call
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Want you to sing, little sparrow, sing
I want you to sing, little sparrow, sing
A pretty bird song
Sing to me, let me hear your agony
Did you say, ""Man's sucking up the land?""
Sing to me of peace and love
Sing to me of God above
Sing sparrow, oh sparrow, sing
Sing to me about man's inhumanity
And all the injustice you see
Sing sparrow, sing, little sparrow, sing
Sing about what to give
Sing about about how to live
I want you to sing your tune sparrow
Oh, little sparrow, sing
Sing to me of jealousy
Aww, sing what that's all about
Sing it all out, shout, little sparrow
Aww, sing at me
Sing me a, sing me a song
I wanna know what's wrong, little bird, tell me
Aww, sparrow

Sing sparrow 'cause I wanna know
You sweet, itty, bitty, pretty bird
Sing before you go
Sing to me, Marvin Gaye before you fly away
Never stop singing sparrow till we hear your song
Sing your song
Sing your song
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and
I remember a bird"

Is love behind me?
Though I need you to satisfy me
Destiny will prove to divide me

Your beauty lies deep within you

Become as one with me

So let me down easy

For all I know is you

Take you for granted?
That could never, never be
An advantage
All this love, and free from demanding
You have always felt the need to be pleased
And you stay close beside me
Though our minds are free for deciding
The life to lead and desiring
To see what they can see
Ooh-ooh

Let me down easy
If ever you were to leave

Ooh-ooh

Ah! Spending time, time with you
Counting the days of my life
Oh, hoping that, that with me
You will stay

So let me down easy
If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down easy
For all I know is you

Being around you
Lovely things I feel are about you
Being strong until I'm without you
For you're the strength in me
And you give me inspiration
Realizing that it has taken
More love and more love makin'
To fulfill my every need

So for me

While driving through the moonlight
We stop at the top of the hill
The night stood still for just a moment
As we share that crystal feel
CHORUS:
Below us, all the city lights and
All the people living their lives
Dreaming their dreams
We sit and hold each other
While listening to our favorite tune
A half bitten room
A loving whisper
To show her I really care
CHORUS:
Below us, all the city lights and
All the people living their lives
Dreaming their dreams
It's time to leave the hilltop
So we can be back before dawn
The moons is gone
The stars are fading
As we turn that one last look

CHORUS:
Below us, all the city lights
How they glow
As we steal a kiss before we go
And now I realize
How much has gone
The tendernes
We have now will last
CHORUS:
Below us, all the city lights
Keep on shining
(All the city lights)
Oh oh oh ... yeah yeah
All the
All the city lights
Oh oh oh ... lights
Where they are above

'Cause sometimes when I'm sitting in the Holiday Inn

Nothin' else to do
I ain't seen my woman since I don't know when

She's got a formula guaranteed to please
You know what, there was once a time
When I ran the streets
And tryin' to sweep all the girls
Off their feet
But that kind of kind, oh
It only destroys
And that's why I have no desire
To paint the town with the boys
I stay home

Tryin' to hold on

For all the wrong I've done
She never once complained
She stuck beside me
All through the sunshine and rain
And I don't gamble with her love
That's something I couldn't stand to lose
Her confidence in me
I don't dare misuse
If I get the urge to go
She may not know where I'm goin'
But I don't stay out late
But I don't fear me
That when I come in
She knows where I been

In my life she's first and she's last
She's my future
And I'm telling y'all
She my past
And for what she's given me
I can never repay
I can only hope (Only hope)

For giving my woman the proper respect
But I don't care

To change my gray skies to blue
And it was strange when you called my name
Ever since that day I haven't been the same, ooh

Then all of a sudden you snuck up from behind

And a very exciting girl (Ooh, so exciting)
You gotta be a special lady (What a lady)
'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world

I was like a song so out of key
Then you came and gave my soul a melody
Thanks to you, for pullin' me through
I've always lost but now I win with you

Before I met you, my sun didn't want to shine
Then all of a sudden you snuck up from behind

Worldly woman that you are it's hard for me to understand
Why you don't see the advantages in loving one man
Could it be that you're afraid, to change your way of life
Loving one man, might make you someones wife

You got to pick up, got to pick up
All you can
You got to pick up, got to pick up
Everyman
You got to pick up, got to pick up
All you can

Life is much to short to, make cool
One can't go through life, breaking all the rules

You got to pick up, got to pick up
All you can
You got to pick up, got to pick up
Every man
You got to pick up, got to pick up
All you can

Let me walk into your life
You need but just one man
I'll be all the things to you, that you think I can
We'll whisper to the mountains us
Those many grains of sand
You'll be one mans woman, I'll be one woman's man

You won't
Have to pick up, have to pick up
All you can, you won't
Have to pick up, have to pick up
Every man, you won't
You got to pick up, have to pick up
All you can"

Now listen.  Oooh
You're pushing my love a little bit too far

Have you ever thought she was trying to get close to me?
Yeah
Think it over
Think it over, girl
Think it over
Look
That's the way I feel about cha

Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
That's the way I feel about cha
I know you been hurt and so has many others too
But that's a sacrifice that life puts you through
Puts you through, puts you through
Trust in me, my dear
Have no fear
You don't know, but God might have sent me here, yeah
(Sent me here)
Think it over
Think it over.  (Think)

Please, please
Please answer love, if it ever comes knocking at your door
(Well, I don't care.)
'Cause what's out there knocking, baby, (Darling)
The world don't give enough of, don't give enough of
I know you been hurt and so has others too
But all you got to do is ask about the changes that life has put them through
Lord have mercy
This is just the way it is
Listen
Don't take my love as a sign of weakness
Check into the situation, girl
Dig a little bit deeper
'Cause that's the way I feel about cha
Oh, that's the way

So if I'm weak for you and I don't light up

Well, don't you lead me back.  (That's the way I feel about cha.)

And if I don't let it fly

Dreams remind me of all the things I’d miss
Could it be I’ll remain in a fantasy like this
Maybe dreams tell of good things to come
Girl won’t you call today
Don’t let me dream my life away
What’s so wrong with wishing that’s the way it could be (wishing that’s the way it could be)
I wish you were real instead of make believe
(So welcome into my dream this is my fantasy)
This is my fantasy
Girl I wish you were here with me
(Welcome in to my dream, into my dream)
Ooh ha-haa

Welcome welcome baby (welcome into my dream, this is my fantasy)
Won’t you please come in
I’m in need of your love (welcome in to my dream, into my dream)
Please let it be
So welcome baby into my dream (welcome into my dream, this is my fantasy)

And mama's got LA gleaming

Jesus rode beside us, but I'm on my own
Speedways, time zones, darling, you kept me hanging on
He set himself on fire
Tried to freeze me out
A self-made pariah
It was all I could do to shout

I'm the woman who loves you
And my heart cannot be still
It's too real, take the hit
Your love, baby, give it up
Don't give it up

Mood rings, pendulums hang while your mood swings
White heat, I lay slain and fall at your feet
Gentle caresses
As the devil possesses me
I taste blood, I'm howling
I writhe and shake and scream

I'm the woman who loves you
And my heart cannot be still
It's too real, take the hit
Your love, baby, give it up
Don't give it up


I can't think straight
Everyone changes their mind
Everyone's changing, I can't concentrate
I can't leave the past behind
See you next time around
Oncoming headlights, I'm free
Heavy morning coming after me
I'll get good again
Oncoming headlights, I'm free

Did you hold somebody's hand today?
Did you try to understand?
Did you help someone whose down beneath the ground?
Then you're giving love
Won't you try and be a friend today?
We can make it all begin
Just a word can light a spark in somebody's heart
Then you're giving love

Who's to say where the road may lead
Loving now is what we need
Or is happiness just a strange illusion?
Life can be what you want it to be
But it's really up to you
Whether or not we all get together
People we going to have to live

Is there is something you can do
Just to make a dream come true?
Standing strong for what is right
Come day or night
Then you're giving love

Who's to say where the road is will lead
Loving now is what we need
Or is happiness just a strange illusion?
Life can be what you want it to be
But it's really up to you
Whether or not we all get together
People we going to have to live

Is there something you can do today
Just to make a dream come true
Standing strong for what is right
Come day or night
Then you're giving love
Someday soon there will appear
Smiling faces reappear
People everywhere will see when you live in harmony
Then you're giving love

Grandma, your generation believed in talk
Scared of the very steps in which you walked
Hey, hey! Father listened to all that was said
Until depression set in leaving miles unfed
And then you came along and tried to use your own head
And think another way
Oh, but the thought was deep within your mind
But you would soon be free one day

But it was just a mere thought
Because you decided to lay it
Then can move with a brand new thing
And all types of different views
And after you rejected me
We became the front page news
We were fighting, quarreling, dying, reading articles
We wanted freedom, justice and equality
These what I lost

Let me tell you
This is The Lost Generation
This is The Lost Generation

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

I was the third brother of five
Doing whatever I had to do to survive
I'm not saying what I did was alright
Trying to break out of the ghetto was a day to day fight
Been down so long, getting up didn't cross my mind
But I knew there was a better way of life that I was just trying to find
You don't know what you'll do until you're put under pressure
'Cross 110th Street is a hell of a tester

Across 110th Street
Pimps trying to catch a woman that's weak
Across 110th Street
Pushers won't let the junkie go free
Across 110th Street
Woman trying to catch a trick on the street
Across 110th Street
You can find it all in the street

Woo, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, oh-oh, oh, oh
I got one more thing I'd like to talk to y'all about right now

Hey brother, there's a better way out
Snorting that coke, shooting that dope, man you're copping out
Take my advice, it's either live or die
You've got to be strong if you want to survive
The family on the other side of town
Would catch hell without a ghetto around
In every city you find the same thing going down
Harlem is the capital of every ghetto town
Help me sing it

(Poverty's paradise)
Hey, it seems to me like ever since I was a little child
I've been starving
I've never known anything but hunger
(Poverty's paradise)
I've been hungry all my life
Yeah, starved to the bone
Somewhere on this raggedy earth
Somebody said something once
About some kind of paradise
Where everything would be nice
(Poverty's)
And together
(Paradise)
But I'll be damned if I can find it
I've grown up into adulthood now
And I don't seem to be able to find my way to anything
Much less somebody's paradise
(Poverty's paradise)
One thing for sure
I'd like to go to sleep just once on a full stomach
I get mighty tired of these belly wrinkles, dig?
And my babies
I don't know what I'm gonna do about them
I've run out of ways to keep them fed
Used to be I could find a way when there wasn't any way
(Poverty's paradise)

Ever since my birth
I've had no one to care
Since my very first day on earth
I've existed on welfare
Shameful living's been my way
Nameless giving's been my pay

Poverty's paradise
If you want it, you better think twice
Poverty's paradise
Who ever said it was nice?
That human was a fool

A poor human's life is filled with woe
No amount of foodstamps can ease sorrow
This way of life demands no respect or dignity
It commands only neglect and self pity
Down life's long and lonely road
Poor has been my one and only load

Poverty's paradise
If you want it, I say you better think twice
Poverty's paradise
Whoever said it was nice?

That human was a fool (fool)

My living's been in vain
My lowly life has known only pain
If you can avoid this kind of misery
Thank God you don't have to live like me
Down life's long and lonely road
Poor has been my one and only load

Poverty's paradise
If you want it, I say you better think twice
Poverty's paradise
Whoever said it was nice?
That human was a fool

(Poverty's paradise)
(Poverty's paradise)
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
(Poverty, poverty's paradise)
It's been one continuous delay
Ever since my birth
(Poverty's paradise)
Hungry, Hungry, Hungry
Lonely, lonely, lonely
(Poverty's paradise)
My love's been in doubt
I've had to do without
(Poverty's paradise)
Only pain, only shame
(Poverty's paradise)
My babies look at me and cry
All I could do is laugh
I tell 'em, son, one day we'll be rich
Daughter, oh, daughter
(Poverty's paradise)
No money to be found
No money to be found
(Poverty's paradise)
Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, yes, yes
(Poverty)
That's what they tell me
Liquidation and distress
That's what they sell me
Free speech, constitutional rights, ain't nowhere to be found
(Poverty's)
Only hunger and grind
(Poverty's)
Global fight after fight
(Poverty's)
Look around

Because neither one of us (Neither one of us)
Ooh, ooh, wants to be the first to say it
Neither one of us (Neither one of us)
Wants to be the first to say it
Ooh, neither one of us (Neither one of us)
Wants to be the first to say
Farewell, my love
Goodbye (Goodbye)"

You touch me, girl
But don'tcha know
You can't hide
No, no, baby
When you give it up
It's only enough
To get me by

You're playin' a game
It's so plain
You want me to win
I'm willin' to play
Whatever you say
If love is the end

Playin' your game, baby
Your game, baby
Just you and me
Playin' your game, baby
Your game, baby
Nobody but you and me


You start, you stop
You know what you got
Is what I need
Oh, yes it is
When you give it up
It's only enough
To make me say
Ooo wee...

That you're playin' a game
It's so plain
You want me to win
Girl, I'll play
What ever you say
If love is the end

Playin' your game, baby
Your game, baby
Just you and me
Playin' your game, baby
Your game, baby
Just you and me
Oh, yeah


Playin' your game, baby
Your game, baby
Just you and me
Playin' your game, baby
Your game, baby
Nobody but you and me"
